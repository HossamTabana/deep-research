```

## Running the Examples

1. Make sure you have TypeScript installed:
```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

2. Install dependencies from the root directory:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the examples:

```

## Example Descriptions

### Basic Example (simple-research.ts)
Demonstrates basic usage of the SDK with minimal configuration. Good starting point for new users.

### Advanced Example (deep-analysis.ts)
Shows three different research approaches:
1. Academic Research: Deep, comprehensive analysis with high confidence requirements
2. Market Research: Broader, faster analysis with more speculative insights
3. Technical Analysis: Focused, expert-level analysis of a specific topic

## Configuration Examples

Each example demonstrates different combinations of:
- Depth settings (1-5 levels)
- Breadth settings (1-5 levels)
- Token limits
- Confidence thresholds
- Reference inclusion
- Topic exploration settings
