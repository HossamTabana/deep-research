result The largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ is a question that lies within the study of elliptic curves and their properties over specific number fields. Elliptic curves are algebraic curves defined by an equation of the form $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$, where $A$ and $B$ are constants [[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve)]. The set of points on an elliptic curve forms an abelian group, and the torsion subgroup consists of points of finite order [[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve)][[7](https://math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/ug_research/presentation2.pdf)].

**Torsion Subgroups of Elliptic Curves**

The torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve $E$ over a field $K$, denoted as $E(K)_{\text{tors}}$, comprises all points of finite order in the group $E(K)$ [[7](https://math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/ug_research/presentation2.pdf)]. The structure of these torsion subgroups has been extensively studied, particularly over quadratic fields [[20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X18301689)][[21](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14514)][[22](https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5906)]. A key result in this area is the classification of possible torsion subgroups for elliptic curves over quadratic fields. The classification of torsion subgroups over quadratic fields is a significant area of research in number theory [[10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X18301537)][[11](https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/722/docs/torsion.pdf)].

**Non-Cyclic Torsion Subgroups**

Non-cyclic torsion subgroups are those that are not generated by a single element. These subgroups are isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ for some integers $n$ and $m$. The existence and structure of non-cyclic torsion subgroups are of particular interest [[32](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022314X18301537)][[33](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021869318301972)].

**Elliptic Curves over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$**

When considering elliptic curves over the quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$, the possible structures of the torsion subgroups are further restricted. The field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ is the quadratic field obtained by adjoining a square root of -3 to the rational numbers [[3](https://www.mathos.unios.hr/~mirela/papers/Q(sqrt(-3)).pdf)]. Determining the largest possible order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup in this specific case requires a detailed analysis of the properties of elliptic curves over this field [[42](https://ctnt-summer.math.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1632/2018/05/2018CTNT-WallaceNotes.pdf)][[43](https://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/gruska/crypto13/crypto_08.pdf)].

**Largest Order Non-Cyclic Torsion Subgroup**

Determining the explicit maximum order of non-cyclic torsion subgroups over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ requires a synthesis of theoretical results and computational verification [[1](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/38127/how-to-generate-the-n-torsion-group-in-an-elliptic-curve)]. While general classifications of torsion subgroups over quadratic fields exist, the specific case of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ may necessitate additional computational or algebraic techniques to pinpoint the largest possible non-cyclic torsion subgroup [[2](https://hdaniels.people.amherst.edu/torsion_over_GenD4.pdf)][[4](https://hdaniels.people.amherst.edu/torsion_over_Q(3).pdf)].

**Examples and Classifications**

Examples of non-cyclic torsion subgroups in elliptic curves can be found, and their structures can be classified [[40](https://planetmath.org/examplesoftorsionsubgroupsofellipticcurves)]. The study of elliptic curves with complex multiplication (CM) can also provide insights into the structure of torsion subgroups [[35](https://www.impan.pl/en/publishing-house/journals-and-series/acta-arithmetica/all/192/2/113282/torsion-groups-of-elliptic-curves-over-quadratic-fields-mathbb-q-sqrt-d-0-lt-d-lt-100)][[36](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/35513/working-on-a-3-torsion-point-on-an-elliptic-curve/)][[37](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9809207)][[38](https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0560)]. However, the provided context does not directly specify the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ [[41](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/295592579_Families_of_elliptic_curves_with_prescribed_torsion_subgroups_over_dihedral_quartic_fields)].

**Further Research**

Further investigation into the literature, possibly using computational tools like SageMath, is needed to determine the explicit maximum order of non-cyclic torsion subgroups over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ [[6](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/arithmetic_curves/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_torsion.html)][[9](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/36487/n-torsion-subgroups-on-elliptic-curves-defined-on-some-field/)]. Engaging with experts in the field may also provide valuable insights [[15](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05993)]. The historical development of the study of torsion subgroups also provides context for current research [[61](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4471620/torsion-subgroup-of-elliptic-curve)][[62](https://alozano.clas.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/490/2018/05/Marseille-Torsion-survey-v2.pdf)][[63](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4983860/calculating-the-torsion-subgroups-of-elliptic-curves)][[64](http://match.stanford.edu/reference/arithmetic_curves/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_torsion.html)].

In summary, while there is extensive research on torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields, the specific determination of the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ requires further focused investigation [[65](https://arxiv.org/html/2401.14514v1)][[66](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04149)][[67](https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2013/REUPapers/Galperin.pdf)][[68](https://web.math.pmf.unizg.hr/~fnajman/skfn.pdf)]. The mathematical properties of elliptic curves, especially those related to complex multiplication and torsion points, are crucial in this exploration [[69](https://hal.science/hal-01914807/document)][[70](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/exploring-elliptic-curve-pairings-c73c1864e627)][[71](https://www.math.uci.edu/~ndonalds/math180b/7elliptic.pdf)][[72](https://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/)][[73](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4801035/rank-of-elliptic-curves-does-not-decrease-under-field-extension)][[74](https://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2323&context=etd)].**Computational Approaches**

Computational tools, such as SageMath, are invaluable for exploring torsion subgroups of elliptic curves [[1](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/38127/how-to-generate-the-n-torsion-group-in-an-elliptic-curve)]. These tools allow mathematicians to perform explicit calculations, identify torsion points, and study the structure of the torsion subgroup [[9](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/36487/n-torsion-subgroups-on-elliptic-curves-defined-on-some-field/)]. For the specific field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$, computational methods can help in identifying elliptic curves with non-cyclic torsion subgroups and determining their orders [[6](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/arithmetic_curves/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_torsion.html)]. SageMath can be used to compute the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over a number field, providing concrete examples and aiding in the classification [[6](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/arithmetic_curves/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_torsion.html)].

**Complex Multiplication and Torsion Subgroups**

Elliptic curves with complex multiplication (CM) have special properties that influence their torsion subgroups [[35](https://www.impan.pl/en/publishing-house/journals-and-series/acta-arithmetica/all/192/2/113282/torsion-groups-of-elliptic-curves-over-quadratic-fields-mathbb-q-sqrt-d-0-lt-d-lt-100)]. An elliptic curve has CM if its endomorphism ring is larger than $\mathbb{Z}$ [[37](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9809207)]. The presence of complex multiplication can restrict or determine the possible torsion subgroups of the elliptic curve [[38](https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0560)]. The field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ is related to elliptic curves with CM by the ring of integers of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$, which is $\mathbb{Z}[(1+\sqrt{-3})/2]$ [[3](https://www.mathos.unios.hr/~mirela/papers/Q(sqrt(-3)).pdf)]. Understanding the implications of CM for torsion subgroups over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ is crucial for determining the largest possible non-cyclic torsion subgroup [[36](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/35513/working-on-a-3-torsion-point-on-an-elliptic-curve/)].

**Specific Examples and Known Results**

While the general theory of torsion subgroups over quadratic fields is well-developed, finding specific examples and results for $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ can be challenging [[40](https://planetmath.org/examplesoftorsionsubgroupsofellipticcurves)]. The literature may contain specific elliptic curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ with explicitly computed torsion subgroups [[41](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/295592579_Families_of_elliptic_curves_with_prescribed_torsion_subgroups_over_dihedral_quartic_fields)]. A targeted search for such examples is essential. It is important to note that the maximal size of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup is bounded, and the goal is to find the precise bound for the given quadratic field [[15](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05993)].

**Mathematical Properties of Elliptic Curves over** $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$

Elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ inherit properties from both elliptic curve theory and algebraic number theory [[42](https://ctnt-summer.math.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1632/2018/05/2018CTNT-WallaceNotes.pdf)]. The field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ has specific algebraic properties that affect the behavior of elliptic curves defined over it [[43](https://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/gruska/crypto13/crypto_08.pdf)]. For instance, the ring of integers of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ is a unique factorization domain, which simplifies some computations [[44](http://koclab.cs.ucsb.edu/teaching/ecc/eccPapers/Washington-ch04.pdf)]. The discriminant of the field also plays a role in determining the structure of torsion subgroups [[45](https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/1600.php)]. Understanding these interactions is vital for a comprehensive analysis [[46](https://www.rareskills.io/post/elliptic-curves-finite-fields)].

**Historical Context**

The study of torsion subgroups has a rich history, with early results providing the foundation for modern research [[61](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4471620/torsion-subgroup-of-elliptic-curve)]. Classical results on elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ and their torsion subgroups paved the way for studying elliptic curves over number fields [[62](https://alozano.clas.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/490/2018/05/Marseille-Torsion-survey-v2.pdf)]. Understanding the historical development helps appreciate the current state of knowledge and the open questions in the field [[63](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4983860/calculating-the-torsion-subgroups-of-elliptic-curves)]. The work of mathematicians like Mazur on torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ serves as a benchmark for research over other number fields [[64](http://match.stanford.edu/reference/arithmetic_curves/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_torsion.html)].

**Current Research and Open Questions**

Despite significant progress, the classification of torsion subgroups over number fields remains an active area of research [[65](https://arxiv.org/html/2401.14514v1)]. Current research focuses on refining the bounds for the possible torsion subgroups and understanding the distribution of torsion subgroups in families of elliptic curves [[66](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04149)]. The question of the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ is part of this broader research program [[67](https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2013/REUPapers/Galperin.pdf)]. New techniques and computational power continue to drive advances in this field [[68](https://web.math.pmf.unizg.hr/~fnajman/skfn.pdf)].

**Further Areas of Investigation**

To determine the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$, several avenues of investigation can be pursued:

1.  **Literature Search**: A more exhaustive search of mathematical databases and online resources may reveal specific results or examples related to $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ [[69](https://hal.science/hal-01914807/document)].
2.  **Computational Experiments**: Using SageMath, one can systematically explore elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ and compute their torsion subgroups [[70](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/exploring-elliptic-curve-pairings-c73c1864e627)].
3.  **Expert Consultation**: Consulting with experts in elliptic curves and number theory can provide valuable insights and guidance [[71](https://www.math.uci.edu/~ndonalds/math180b/7elliptic.pdf)].
4.  **Theoretical Analysis**: A deeper theoretical analysis of the properties of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$, taking into account the CM structure, may lead to a proof of the maximal order [[72](https://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/)].

**Summary**

The determination of the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ is a complex problem that requires a combination of theoretical knowledge, computational techniques, and a thorough literature review [[73](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4801035/rank-of-elliptic-curves-does-not-decrease-under-field-extension)]. While general results on torsion subgroups over quadratic fields exist, the specific case of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ demands a more focused approach [[74](https://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2323&context=etd)]. By leveraging computational tools, understanding the implications of complex multiplication, and consulting with experts, it may be possible to pinpoint the exact maximal order. The research in this area continues to evolve, and new results may shed light on this question in the future.**Refining the Search for the Largest Non-Cyclic Torsion Subgroup**

To effectively narrow down the possibilities for the largest non-cyclic torsion subgroup over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$, it's crucial to refine our search by considering specific properties and theorems related to elliptic curves and number fields. This involves a multi-faceted approach, combining theoretical insights with computational explorations.

**Theoretical Considerations**

1.  **Oesterlé's Theorem (Uniform Boundedness Theorem):** This theorem provides a bound on the size of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields of a given degree [[15](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05993)]. While it doesn't give the exact answer for $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$, it provides a limit to the possible orders we need to check. Understanding the implications of this theorem helps to avoid unnecessary computations.

2.  **Complex Multiplication (CM) Curves:** Elliptic curves with complex multiplication have special properties that can simplify the determination of their torsion subgroups [[35](https://www.impan.pl/en/publishing-house/journals-and-series/acta-arithmetica/all/192/2/113282/torsion-groups-of-elliptic-curves-over-quadratic-fields-mathbb-q-sqrt-d-0-lt-d-lt-100)]. The field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ is closely related to CM elliptic curves, as it is the field of definition for the CM by $\mathbb{Z}[(\frac{1 + \sqrt{-3}}{2})]$ [[3](https://www.mathos.unios.hr/~mirela/papers/Q(sqrt(-3)).pdf)]. This connection suggests that we should focus on CM curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ as potential candidates for having large non-cyclic torsion subgroups [[36](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/35513/working-on-a-3-torsion-point-on-an-elliptic-curve/)][[37](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9809207)][[38](https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0560)].

3.  **Torsion Subgroups and Isogenies:** The existence of isogenies (non-constant morphisms between elliptic curves) can provide information about the structure of torsion subgroups [[9](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/36487/n-torsion-subgroups-on-elliptic-curves-defined-on-some-field/)]. If an elliptic curve $E$ has an isogeny to another curve $E'$, then the torsion subgroups of $E$ and $E'$ are related. This relationship can be exploited to find curves with specific torsion structures [[6](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/arithmetic_curves/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_torsion.html)].

**Computational Strategies**

1.  **SageMath Exploration:** Use SageMath to generate elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ and compute their torsion subgroups [[1](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/38127/how-to-generate-the-n-torsion-group-in-an-elliptic-curve)]. This involves defining the number field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ in SageMath and then creating elliptic curves with coefficients in this field. The `.torsion_subgroup()` method in SageMath can then be used to compute the torsion subgroup of each curve [[6](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/arithmetic_curves/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_torsion.html)].

2.  **Database Searches:** Explore existing databases of elliptic curves, such as the LMFDB (L-functions and Modular Forms Database), to find elliptic curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ with known torsion subgroups [[72](https://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/)]. These databases may contain examples of curves with large non-cyclic torsion subgroups [[72](https://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/)].

3.  **Systematic Search:** Implement a systematic search for elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ with specific properties. This could involve searching for curves with a given discriminant or j-invariant, and then computing their torsion subgroups [[6](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/arithmetic_curves/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_torsion.html)].

**Examples and Known Results**

1.  **Known Torsion Structures:** Recall that the possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields are classified [[20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X18301689)][[21](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14514)][[22](https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5906)]. This classification provides a list of possible groups that can occur as torsion subgroups. We need to determine which of these groups can occur for elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$, and what is the largest non-cyclic group in this list [[10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X18301537)][[11](https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/722/docs/torsion.pdf)].

2.  **Specific Examples:** Search for specific examples of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ with explicitly computed torsion subgroups [[40](https://planetmath.org/examplesoftorsionsubgroupsofellipticcurves)]. These examples can provide concrete evidence for the existence of certain torsion structures and help to refine our understanding of the possibilities [[41](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/295592579_Families_of_elliptic_curves_with_prescribed_torsion_subgroups_over_dihedral_quartic_fields)].

**Mathematical Properties of Elliptic Curves over** $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$

1.  **Ring of Integers:** The ring of integers of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ is $\mathbb{Z}[(\frac{1 + \sqrt{-3}}{2})]$, which is a unique factorization domain [[44](http://koclab.cs.ucsb.edu/teaching/ecc/eccPapers/Washington-ch04.pdf)]. This property simplifies some computations and allows us to use algebraic techniques to study elliptic curves over this field [[45](https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/1600.php)].

2.  **Discriminant:** The discriminant of the field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ is -3, which affects the ramification of primes in the field [[45](https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/1600.php)]. This ramification can influence the structure of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves defined over the field [[46](https://www.rareskills.io/post/elliptic-curves-finite-fields)].

**Historical Context**

1.  **Early Results:** Review the historical development of the study of torsion subgroups, starting with the work of Mazur on elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ [[61](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4471620/torsion-subgroup-of-elliptic-curve)][[62](https://alozano.clas.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/490/2018/05/Marseille-Torsion-survey-v2.pdf)][[63](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4983860/calculating-the-torsion-subgroups-of-elliptic-curves)][[64](http://match.stanford.edu/reference/arithmetic_curves/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_torsion.html)]. Understanding the evolution of the field helps to appreciate the current state of knowledge and the open questions [[61](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4471620/torsion-subgroup-of-elliptic-curve)].

**Current Research and Open Questions**

1.  **Active Research Area:** Recognize that the classification of torsion subgroups over number fields is an active area of research [[65](https://arxiv.org/html/2401.14514v1)]. Current research focuses on refining the bounds for the possible torsion subgroups and understanding the distribution of torsion subgroups in families of elliptic curves [[66](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04149)]. The question of the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ is part of this broader research program [[67](https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2013/REUPapers/Galperin.pdf)].

**Further Areas of Investigation**

1.   **Expert Consultation:** Seek guidance from experts in elliptic curves and number theory [[71](https://www.math.uci.edu/~ndonalds/math180b/7elliptic.pdf)]. Their insights and expertise can be invaluable in navigating the complexities of this problem [[71](https://www.math.uci.edu/~ndonalds/math180b/7elliptic.pdf)].

**Summary**

Determining the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ requires a combination of theoretical knowledge, computational techniques, and a thorough literature review [[73](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4801035/rank-of-elliptic-curves-does-not-decrease-under-field-extension)]. While general results on torsion subgroups over quadratic fields exist, the specific case of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ demands a more focused approach [[74](https://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2323&context=etd)]. By leveraging computational tools, understanding the implications of complex multiplication, and consulting with experts, it may be possible to pinpoint the exact maximal order. The research in this area continues to evolve, and new results may shed light on this question in the future.

**Specific Torsion Subgroup Structures**

To further refine our search, let's consider the possible structures of non-cyclic torsion subgroups. Over $\mathbb{Q}$, the only non-cyclic torsion subgroup is $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ [[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve)]. However, over quadratic fields, other non-cyclic torsion subgroups can occur [[20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X18301689)][[21](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14514)][[22](https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5906)].

**Possible Non-Cyclic Torsion Subgroups**

The possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields are of the form $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$, where $n$ divides $m$. The known possibilities are:

*   $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$
*   $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$
*   $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z}$
*   $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/8\mathbb{Z}$
*   $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2n\mathbb{Z}$ for some integer n.

Our goal is to determine which of these can occur over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$, and what is the largest possible value of $m$ such that $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ is a torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$.

**Computational Verification with SageMath**

We can use SageMath to explore these possibilities. The following code snippet demonstrates how to define the field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ and create elliptic curves over it:

```python
K. = QuadraticField(-3)
E = EllipticCurve(K, [a, b])  # Replace a and b with coefficients in K
T = E.torsion_subgroup()
print(T)
```

By varying the coefficients $a$ and $b$, we can systematically search for elliptic curves with different torsion subgroups. We can also use the `is_isogenous()` method to check if two elliptic curves are isogenous, which can provide information about their torsion subgroups.

**Complex Multiplication and Torsion**

Since $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ is related to elliptic curves with complex multiplication, we should focus on curves with CM. These curves have special properties that can simplify the determination of their torsion subgroups. For example, if an elliptic curve $E$ has CM by the ring of integers of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$, then its endomorphism ring contains $\mathbb{Z}[(\frac{1 + \sqrt{-3}}{2})]$. This can restrict the possible torsion subgroups of $E$.

**Specific Examples and Known Results**

We need to search for specific examples of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ with explicitly computed torsion subgroups. These examples can provide concrete evidence for the existence of certain torsion structures and help to refine our understanding of the possibilities. It is important to note that the maximal size of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup is bounded, and the goal is to find the precise bound for the given quadratic field.

**Mathematical Properties of Elliptic Curves over** $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$

Elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ inherit properties from both elliptic curve theory and algebraic number theory. The field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ has specific algebraic properties that affect the behavior of elliptic curves defined over it. For instance, the ring of integers of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ is a unique factorization domain, which simplifies some computations. The discriminant of the field also plays a role in determining the structure of torsion subgroups. Understanding these interactions is vital for a comprehensive analysis.

**Historical Context**

The study of torsion subgroups has a rich history, with early results providing the foundation for modern research. Classical results on elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ and their torsion subgroups paved the way for studying elliptic curves over number fields. Understanding the historical development helps appreciate the current state of knowledge and the open questions in the field. The work of mathematicians like Mazur on torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ serves as a benchmark for research over other number fields.

**Current Research and Open Questions**

Despite significant progress, the classification of torsion subgroups over number fields remains an active area of research. Current research focuses on refining the bounds for the possible torsion subgroups and understanding the distribution of torsion subgroups in families of elliptic curves. The question of the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ is part of this broader research program. New techniques and computational power continue to drive advances in this field.

**Further Areas of Investigation**

To determine the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$, several avenues of investigation can be pursued:

1.  **Literature Search:** A more exhaustive search of mathematical databases and online resources may reveal specific results or examples related to $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ [[69](https://hal.science/hal-01914807/document)].
2.  **Computational Experiments:** Using SageMath, one can systematically explore elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ and compute their torsion subgroups [[70](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/exploring-elliptic-curve-pairings-c73c1864e627)].
3.  **Expert Consultation:** Consulting with experts in elliptic curves and number theory can provide valuable insights and guidance [[71](https://www.math.uci.edu/~ndonalds/math180b/7elliptic.pdf)].
4.  **Theoretical Analysis:** A deeper theoretical analysis of the properties of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$, taking into account the CM structure, may lead to a proof of the maximal order [[72](https://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/)].

**Summary**

The determination of the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ is a complex problem that requires a combination of theoretical knowledge, computational techniques, and a thorough literature review [[73](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4801035/rank-of-elliptic-curves-does-not-decrease-under-field-extension)]. While general results on torsion subgroups over quadratic fields exist, the specific case of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ demands a more focused approach [[74](https://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2323&context=etd)]. By leveraging computational tools, understanding the implications of complex multiplication, and consulting with experts, it may be possible to pinpoint the exact maximal order. The research in this area continues to evolve, and new results may shed light on this question in the future.
