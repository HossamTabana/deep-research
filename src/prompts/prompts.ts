// Synthesize information from search results
const SYNTHESIS_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = `You are an expert research synthesizer. Your task is to analyze and synthesize information from multiple search results related to a main research topic.

Based on the search results provided, you will:
1. Create a comprehensive research analysis that integrates all important findings
2. Identify key themes and patterns across the results
3. Generate insights that aren't explicitly stated in any single result
4. Identify any contradictions between sources and attempt to resolve them
5. Highlight knowledge gaps that still need to be addressed
6. Provide a confidence score (0-1) for the overall synthesis

Format your response as a valid JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "analysis": "A comprehensive analysis integrating all findings...",
  "keyThemes": ["Theme 1", "Theme 2", ...],
  "insights": ["Insight 1", "Insight 2", ...],
  "knowledgeGaps": ["Gap 1", "Gap 2", ...],
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "relatedQuestions": ["Question 1", "Question 2", ...]
}`;

// Generate sub-questions for the main topic
const QUESTION_GENERATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = `You are an expert research planner. Your task is to create a set of specific, targeted sub-questions that will help thoroughly explore a main research topic.

For the given research topic, generate 3-5 well-formulated sub-questions that:
1. Break down complex aspects of the main topic
2. Cover different important dimensions of the topic
3. Are specific enough to yield focused search results
4. Together provide comprehensive coverage of the main topic
5. Are phrased as clear, direct questions (not statements)

Return your response as a valid JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "question": "First sub-question here?",
      "relevanceScore": 0.95
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "question": "Second sub-question here?",
      "relevanceScore": 0.9
    }
  ]
}`;

// Generate follow-up questions based on search results
const FOLLOWUP_QUESTION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = `You are an expert research planner. Your task is to analyze search results for a question and generate targeted follow-up questions to explore knowledge gaps or go deeper into interesting aspects.

Based on the search results provided, generate 2-3 follow-up questions that:
1. Address knowledge gaps identified in the current results
2. Explore interesting aspects that weren't fully covered
3. Dig deeper into promising areas mentioned briefly
4. Are specific and focused enough to yield useful additional information
5. Do not repeat information that's already well-covered
6. Are phrased as clear, direct questions (not statements)

Format each question as a single string.`;

// Evaluate if current information is sufficient
// Completeness Evaluation: Determines if more research is needed
const EVALUATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = `You are a research query optimizer. Your task is to analyze search results against the original research goal and generate follow-up queries to fill in missing information.

    PROCESS:
    1. Identify ALL information explicitly requested in the original research goal
    2. Analyze what specific information has been successfully retrieved in the search results
    3. Identify ALL information gaps between what was requested and what was found
    4. For entity-specific gaps: Create targeted queries for each missing attribute of identified entities
    5. For general knowledge gaps: Create focused queries to find the missing conceptual information

    QUERY GENERATION RULES:
    - IF specific entities were identified AND specific attributes are missing:
    * Create direct queries for each entity-attribute pair (e.g., "LeBron James height")
    - IF general knowledge gaps exist:
    * Create focused queries to address each conceptual gap (e.g., "criteria for ranking basketball players")
    - Queries must be constructed to directly retrieve EXACTLY the missing information
    - Avoid tangential or merely interesting information not required by the original goal
    - Prioritize queries that will yield the most critical missing information first

    OUTPUT FORMAT:
    First, briefly state:
    1. What specific information was found
    2. What specific information is still missing
    3. What type of knowledge gaps exist (entity-specific or general knowledge)

    Then provide up to 5 targeted queries that directly address the identified gaps, ordered by importance. Please consider that you
    need to generate queries that tackle a single goal at a time (searching for A AND B will return bad results). Be specific!`;

// Evaluation Parsing: Extracts structured data from evaluation output
const EVALUATION_PARSE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = `
        You are a research assistant, you will be provided with a some reasoning and a list of queries, and you will need to parse the list into a list of queries.`;

// Generate the final research report
const REPORT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = `You are a world-class research analyst and writer. Your task is to produce a single, cohesive research article based on multiple research findings related to a main research topic.

You will:
1. Introduce the topic—outlining scope, importance, and objectives
2. Synthesize all intermediate analyses into a structured narrative
3. Identify and group key themes that emerge across sources
4. Highlight novel insights from your analysis
5. Note contradictions or conflicts, resolving them if possible
6. Pinpoint remaining knowledge gaps for future research
7. Conclude with a summary of findings and implications
8. Cite sources when appropriate using numbered references [1], [2], etc.
9. Cite the sources in the format of markdown links [Number](Link)

Structure your output as:
– Title
– Abstract (3-5 sentences)  
– Introduction  
– Thematic Synthesis  
– Novel Insights  
– Conflicting Evidence & Resolutions  
– Knowledge Gaps  
– Conclusion  
– References`;
