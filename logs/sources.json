Consider, for instance, Aristotle on the human function, Aquinas on the beatific vision, and Kant on the highest good. Relatedly, think about Koheleth, the presumed author of the Biblical book Ecclesiastes, describing life as  futility  and akin to  the pursuit of wind,  Nietzsche on nihilism, as well as Schopenhauer when he remarks that whenever we reach a goal we have longed for we discover  how vain and empty it is. While these concepts have some bearing on happiness and virtue (and their opposites), they are straightforwardly construed (roughly) as accounts of which highly ranked purposes a person ought to realize that would make her life significant (if any would). Despite the venerable pedigree, it is only since the 1980 s or so that a distinct field of the meaning of life has been established in Anglo - American - Australasian philosophy, on which this survey focuses, and it is only in the past 20 years that debate with real depth and intricacy has appeared. Two decades ago analytic reflection on life s meaning was described as a  backwater  compared to that on well - being or good character, and it was possible to cite nearly all the literature in a given critical discussion of the field (Metz 2002). Neither is true any longer. Anglo - American - Australasian philosophy of life s meaning has become vibrant, such that there is now way too much literature to be able to cite comprehensively in this survey. To obtain focus, it tends to discuss books, influential essays, and more recent works, and it leaves aside contributions from other philosophical traditions (such as the Continental or African) and from non - philosophical fields (e.g., psychology or literature). This survey s central aim is to acquaint the reader with current analytic approaches to life s meaning, sketching major debates and pointing out neglected topics that merit further consideration. When the topic of the meaning of life comes up, people tend to pose one of three questions:  What are you talking about? ,  What is the meaning of life? , and  Is life in fact meaningful? . The literature on life's meaning composed by those working in the analytic tradition (on which this entry focuses) can be usefully organized according to which question it seeks to answer. This survey starts off with recent work that addresses the first, abstract (or  meta ) question regarding the sense of talk of  life s meaning,  i.e., that aims to clarify what we have in mind when inquiring into the meaning of life (section 1). Afterward, it considers texts that provide answers to the more substantive question about the nature of meaningfulness (sections 2 3). There is in the making a sub - field of applied meaning that parallels applied ethics, in which meaningfulness is considered in the context of particular cases or specific themes. Examples include downshifting (Levy 2005), implementing genetic enhancements (Agar 2013), making achievements (Bradford 2015), getting an education (Schinkel et al. 2015), interacting with research participants (Olson 2016), automating labor (Danaher 2017), and creating children (Ferracioli 2018). In contrast, this survey focuses nearly exclusively on contemporary normative - theoretical approaches to life s meanining, that is, attempts to capture in a single, general principle all the variegated conditions that could confer meaning on life. Finally, this survey examines fresh arguments for the nihilist view that the conditions necessary for a meaningful life do not obtain for any of us, i.e., that all our lives are meaningless (section 4). 1.

The Meaning of  Meaning  One of the field's aims consists of the systematic attempt to identify what people (essentially or characteristically) have in mind when they think about the topic of life s meaning. For many in the field, terms such as  importance  and  significance  are synonyms of  meaningfulness  and so are insufficiently revealing, but there are those who draw a distinction between meaningfulness and significance (Singer 1996, 112 18; Belliotti 2019, 145 50, 186). There is also debate about how the concept of a meaningless life relates to the ideas of a life that is absurd (Nagel 1970, 1986, 214 23; Feinberg 1980; Belliotti 2019), futile (Trisel 2002), and not worth living (Landau 2017, 12 15; Matheson 2017). A useful way to begin to get clear about what thinking about life s meaning involves is to specify the bearer. Which life does the inquirer have in mind? A standard distinction to draw is between the meaning  in  life, where a human person is what can exhibit meaning, and the meaning  of  life in a narrow sense, where the human species as a whole is what can be meaningful or not. There has also been a bit of recent consideration of whether animals or human infants can have meaning in their lives, with most rejecting that possibility (e.g., Wong 2008, 131, 147; Fischer 2019, 1 24), but a handful of others beginning to make a case for it (Purves and Delon 2018; Thomas 2018). Also under - explored is the issue of whether groups, such as a people or an organization, can be bearers of meaning, and, if so, under what conditions. Most analytic philosophers have been interested in meaning in life, that is, in the meaningfulness that a person s life could exhibit, with comparatively few these days addressing the meaning of life in the narrow sense. Even those who believe that God is or would be central to life s meaning have lately addressed how an individual s life might be meaningful in virtue of God more often than how the human race might be. Although some have argued that the meaningfulness of human life as such merits inquiry to no less a degree (if not more) than the meaning in a life (Seachris 2013; Tartaglia 2015; cf. Trisel 2016), a large majority of the field has instead been interested in whether their lives as individual persons (and the lives of those they care about) are meaningful and how they could become more so. Focusing on meaning in life, it is quite common to maintain that it is conceptually something good for its own sake or, relatedly, something that provides a basic reason for action (on which see Visak 2017). There are a few who have recently suggested otherwise, maintaining that there can be neutral or even undesirable kinds of meaning in a person s life (e.g., Mawson 2016, 90, 193; Thomas 2018, 291, 294). However, these are outliers, with most analytic philosophers, and presumably laypeople, instead wanting to know when an individual s life exhibits a certain kind of final value (or non - instrumental reason for action). Another claim about which there is substantial consensus is that meaningfulness is not all or nothing and instead comes in degrees, such that some periods of life are more meaningful than others and that some lives as a whole are more meaningful than others. Note that one can coherently hold the view that some people s lives are less meaningful (or even in a certain sense less  important ) than others, or are even meaningless (unimportant), and still maintain that people have an equal standing from a moral point of view. Consider a consequentialist moral principle according to which each individual counts for one in virtue of having a capacity for a meaningful life, or a Kantian approach according to which all people have a dignity in virtue of their capacity for autonomous decision - making, where meaning is a function of the exercise of this capacity. For both moral outlooks, we could be required to help people with relatively meaningless lives. Yet another relatively uncontroversial element of the concept of meaningfulness in respect of individual persons is that it is logically distinct from happiness or rightness (emphasized in Wolf 2010, 2016). First, to ask whether someone s life is meaningful is not one and the same as asking whether her life is pleasant or she is subjectively well off. A life in an experience machine or virtual reality device would surely be a happy one, but very few take it to be a prima facie candidate for meaningfulness (Nozick 1974: 42 45). Indeed, a number would say that one s life logically could become meaningful precisely by sacrificing one s well - being, e.g., by helping others at the expense of one s self - interest. Second, asking whether a person s existence over time is meaningful is not identical to considering whether she has been morally upright; there are intuitively ways to enhance meaning that have nothing to do with right action or moral virtue, such as making a scientific discovery or becoming an excellent dancer. Now, one might argue that a life would be meaningless if, or even because, it were unhappy or immoral, but that would be to posit a synthetic, substantive relationship between the concepts, far from indicating that speaking of  meaningfulness  is analytically a matter of connoting ideas regarding happiness or rightness. The question of what (if anything) makes a person s life meaningful is conceptually distinct from the questions of what makes a life happy or moral, although it could turn out that the best answer to the former question appeals to an answer to one of the latter questions. Supposing, then, that talk of  meaning in life  connotes something good for its own sake that can come in degrees and that is not analytically equivalent to happiness or rightness, what else does it involve? What more can we say about this final value, by definition? Most contemporary analytic philosophers would say that the relevant value is absent from spending time in an experience machine (but see Goetz 2012 for a different view) or living akin to Sisyphus, the mythic figure doomed by the Greek gods to roll a stone up a hill for eternity (famously discussed by Albert Camus and Taylor 1970). In addition, many would say that the relevant value is typified by the classic triad of  the good, the true, and the beautiful  (or would be under certain conditions). These terms are not to be taken literally, but instead are rough catchwords for beneficent relationships (love, collegiality, morality), intellectual reflection (wisdom, education, discoveries), and creativity (particularly the arts, but also potentially things like humor or gardening). Pressing further, is there something that the values of the good, the true, the beautiful, and any other logically possible sources of meaning involve? There is as yet no consensus in the field. One salient view is that the concept of meaning in life is a cluster or amalgam of overlapping ideas, such as fulfilling higher - order purposes, meriting substantial esteem or admiration, having a noteworthy impact, transcending one s animal nature, making sense, or exhibiting a compelling life - story (Markus 2003; Thomson 2003; Metz 2013, 24 35; Seachris 2013, 3 4; Mawson 2016). However, there are philosophers who maintain that something much more monistic is true of the concept, so that (nearly) all thought about meaningfulness in a person s life is essentially about a single property. Suggestions include being devoted to or in awe of qualitatively superior goods (Taylor 1989, 3 24), transcending one s limits (Levy 2005), or making a contribution (Martela 2016). Recently there has been something of an  interpretive turn  in the field, one instance of which is the strong view that meaning - talk is logically about whether and how a life is intelligible within a wider frame of reference (Goldman 2018, 116 29; Seachris 2019; Thomas 2019; cf. Repp 2018). According to this approach, inquiring into life s meaning is nothing other than seeking out sense - making information, perhaps a narrative about life or an explanation of its source and destiny. This analysis has the advantage of promising to unify a wide array of uses of the term  meaning. However, it has the disadvantages of being unable to capture the intuitions that meaning in life is essentially good for its own sake (Landau 2017, 12 15), that it is not logically contradictory to maintain that an ineffable condition is what confers meaning on life (as per Cooper 2003, 126 42; Bennett - Hunter 2014; Waghorn 2014), and that often human actions themselves (as distinct from an interpretation of them), such as rescuing a child from a burning building, are what bear meaning. Some thinkers have suggested that a complete analysis of the concept of life s meaning should include what has been called  anti - matter  (Metz 2002, 805 07, 2013, 63 65, 71 73) or  anti - meaning  (Campbell and Nyholm 2015; Egerstrom 2015), conditions that reduce the meaningfulness of a life. The thought is that meaning is well represented by a bipolar scale, where there is a dimension of not merely positive conditions, but also negative ones. Gratuitous cruelty or destructiveness are prima facie candidates for actions that not merely fail to add meaning, but also subtract from any meaning one s life might have had. Despite the ongoing debates about how to analyze the concept of life s meaning (or articulate the definition of the phrase  meaning in life ), the field remains in a good position to make progress on the other key questions posed above, viz., of what would make a life meaningful and whether any lives are in fact meaningful. A certain amount of common ground is provided by the point that meaningfulness at least involves a gradient final value in a person s life that is conceptually distinct from happiness and rightness, with exemplars of it potentially being the good, the true, and the beautiful. The rest of this discussion addresses philosophical attempts to capture the nature of this value theoretically and to ascertain whether it exists in at least some of our lives. 2. Supernaturalism Most analytic philosophers writing on meaning in life have been trying to develop and evaluate theories, i.e., fundamental and general principles, that are meant to capture all the particular ways that a life could obtain meaning. As in moral philosophy, there are recognizable  anti - theorists,  i.e., those who maintain that there is too much pluralism among meaning conditions to be able to unify them in the form of a principle (e.g., Kekes 2000; Hosseini 2015). Arguably, though, the systematic search for unity is too nascent to be able to draw a firm conclusion about whether it is available. The theories are standardly divided on a metaphysical basis, that is, in terms of which kinds of properties are held to constitute the meaning. Supernaturalist theories are views according to which a spiritual realm is central to meaning in life. Most Western philosophers have conceived of the spiritual in terms of God or a soul as commonly understood in the Abrahamic faiths (but see Mulgan 2015 for discussion of meaning in the context of a God uninterested in us). In contrast, naturalist theories are views that the physical world as known particularly well by the scientific method is central to life s meaning. There is logical space for a non - naturalist theory, according to which central to meaning is an abstract property that is neither spiritual nor physical. However, only scant attention has been paid to this possibility in the recent Anglo - American - Australasian literature (Audi 2005). It is important to note that supernaturalism, a claim that God (or a soul) would confer meaning on a life, is logically distinct from theism, the claim that God (or a soul) exists. Although most who hold supernaturalism also hold theism, one could accept the former without the latter (as Camus more or less did), committing one to the view that life is meaningless or at least lacks substantial meaning. Similarly, while most naturalists are atheists, it is not contradictory to maintain that God exists but has nothing to do with meaning in life or perhaps even detracts from it. Although these combinations of positions are logically possible, some of them might be substantively implausible. The field could benefit from discussion of the comparative attractiveness of various combinations of evaluative claims about what would make life meaningful and metaphysical claims about whether spiritual conditions exist. Over the past 15 years or so, two different types of supernaturalism have become distinguished on a regular basis (Metz 2019). That is true not only in the literature on life s meaning, but also in that on the related pro - theism anti - theism debate, about whether it would be desirable for God or a soul to exist (e.g., Kahane 2011; Kraay 2018; Lougheed 2020). On the one hand, there is extreme supernaturalism, according to which spiritual conditions are necessary for any meaning in life. If neither God nor a soul exists, then, by this view, everyone s life is meaningless. On the other hand, there is moderate supernaturalism, according to which spiritual conditions are necessary for a great or ultimate meaning in life, although not meaning in life as such. If neither God nor a soul exists, then, by this view, everyone s life could have some meaning, or even be meaningful, but no one s life could exhibit the most desirable meaning. For a moderate supernaturalist, God or a soul would substantially enhance meaningfulness or be a major contributory condition for it. There are a variety of ways that great or ultimate meaning has been described, sometimes quantitatively as  infinite  (Mawson 2016), qualitatively as  deeper  (Swinburne 2016), relationally as  unlimited  (Nozick 1981, 618 19; cf. Waghorn 2014), temporally as  eternal  (Cottingham 2016), and perspectivally as  from the point of view of the universe  (Benatar 2017). There has been no reflection as yet on the crucial question of how these distinctions might bear on each another, for instance, on whether some are more basic than others or some are more valuable than others. Cross - cutting the extreme moderate distinction is one between God - centered theories and soul - centered ones. According to the former, some kind of connection with God (understood to be a spiritual person who is all - knowing, all - good, and all - powerful and who is the ground of the physical universe) constitutes meaning in life, even if one lacks a soul (construed as an immortal, spiritual substance that contains one s identity). In contrast, by the latter, having a soul and putting it into a certain state is what makes life meaningful, even if God does not exist. Many supernaturalists of course believe that God and a soul are jointly necessary for a (greatly) meaningful existence. However, the simpler view, that only one of them is necessary, is common, and sometimes arguments proffered for the complex view fail to support it any more than the simpler one. 2.1. God - centered Views The most influential God - based account of meaning in life has been the extreme view that one s existence is significant if and only if one fulfills a purpose God has assigned. The familiar idea is that God has a plan for the universe and that one s life is meaningful just to the degree that one helps God realize this plan, perhaps in a particular way that God wants one to do so. If a person failed to do what God intends her to do with her life (or if God does not even exist), then, on the current view, her life would be meaningless. Thinkers differ over what it is about God s purpose that might make it uniquely able to confer meaning on human lives, but the most influential argument has been that only God s purpose could be the source of invariant moral rules (Davis 1987, 296, 304 05; Moreland 1987, 124 29; Craig 1994 2013, 161 67) or of objective values more generally (Cottingham 2005, 37 57), where a lack of such would render our lives nonsensical. According to this argument, lower goods such as animal pleasure or desire satisfaction could exist without God, but higher ones pertaining to meaning in life, particularly moral virtue, could not. However, critics point to many non - moral sources of meaning in life (e.g., Kekes 2000; Wolf 2010), with one arguing that a universal moral code is not necessary for meaning in life, even if, say, beneficent actions are (Ellin 1995, 327). In addition, there are a variety of naturalist and non - naturalist accounts of objective morality  and of value more generally  on offer these days, so that it is not clear that it must have a supernatural source in God s will. One recurrent objection to the idea that God s purpose could make life meaningful is that if God had created us with a purpose in mind, then God would have degraded us and thereby undercut the possibility of us obtaining meaning from fulfilling the purpose. The objection harks back to Jean - Paul Sartre, but in the analytic literature it appears that Kurt Baier was the first to articulate it (1957 2000, 118 20; see also Murphy 1982, 14 15; Singer 1996, 29; Kahane 2011; Lougheed 2020, 121 41). Sometimes the concern is the threat of punishment God would make so that we do God s bidding, while other times it is that the source of meaning would be constrictive and not up to us, and still other times it is that our dignity would be maligned simply by having been created with a certain end in mind (for some replies to such concerns, see Hanfling 1987, 45 46; Cottingham 2005, 37 57; Lougheed 2020, 111 21). There is a different argument for an extreme God - based view that focuses less on God as purposive and more on God as infinite, unlimited, or ineffable, which Robert Nozick first articulated with care (Nozick 1981, 594 618; see also Bennett - Hunter 2014; Waghorn 2014). The core idea is that for a finite condition to be meaningful, it must obtain its meaning from another condition that has meaning. So, if one s life is meaningful, it might be so in virtue of being married to a person, who is important. Being finite, the spouse must obtain his or her importance from elsewhere, perhaps from the sort of work he or she does. This work also must obtain its meaning by being related to something else that is meaningful, and so on. A regress on meaningful conditions is present, and the suggestion is that the regress can terminate only in something so all - encompassing that it need not (indeed, cannot) go beyond itself to obtain meaning from anything else. And that is God. The standard objection to this relational rationale is that a finite condition could be meaningful without obtaining its meaning from another meaningful condition. Perhaps it could be meaningful in itself, without being connected to something beyond it, or maybe it could obtain its meaning by being related to something else that is beautiful or otherwise valuable for its own sake but not meaningful (Nozick 1989, 167 68; Thomson 2003, 25 26, 48). A serious concern for any extreme God - based view is the existence of apparent counterexamples. If we think of the stereotypical lives of Albert Einstein, Mother Teresa, and Pablo Picasso, they seem meaningful even if we suppose there is no all - knowing, all - powerful, and all - good spiritual person who is the ground of the physical world (e.g., Wielenberg 2005, 31 37, 49 50; Landau 2017). Even religiously inclined philosophers have found this hard to deny these days (Quinn 2000, 58; Audi 2005; Mawson 2016, 5; Williams 2020, 132 34). Largely for that reason, contemporary supernaturalists have tended to opt for moderation, that is, to maintain that God would greatly enhance the meaning in our lives, even if some meaning would be possible in a world without God. One approach is to invoke the relational argument to show that God is necessary, not for any meaning whatsoever, but rather for an ultimate meaning. Limited transcendence, the transcending of our limits so as to connect with a wider context of value which itself is limited, does give our lives meaning  but a limited one. We may thirst for more  (Nozick 1981, 618). Another angle is to appeal to playing a role in God s plan, again to claim, not that it is essential for meaning as such, but rather for  a cosmic significance...intead of a significance very limited in time and space  (Swinburne 2016, 154; see also Quinn 2000; Cottingham 2016, 131). Another rationale is that by fulfilling God s purpose, we would meaningfully please God, a perfect person, as well as be remembered favorably by God forever (Cottingham 2016, 135; Williams 2020, 21 22, 29, 101, 108). Still another argument is that only with God could the deepest desires of human nature be satisfied (e.g., Goetz 2012; Seachris 2013, 20; Cottingham 2016, 127, 136), even if more surface desires could be satisfied without God. In reply to such rationales for a moderate supernaturalism, there has been the suggestion that it is precisely by virtue of being alone in the universe that our lives would be particularly significant; otherwise, God s greatness would overshadow us (Kahane 2014). There has also been the response that, with the opportunity for greater meaning from God would also come that for greater anti - meaning, so that it is not clear that a world with God would offer a net gain in respect of meaning (Metz 2019, 34 35). For example, if pleasing God would greatly enhance meaning in our lives, then presumably displeasing God would greatly reduce it and to a comparable degree. In addition, there are arguments for extreme naturalism (or its  anti - theist  cousin) mentioned below (sub - section 3.3). 2.2. Soul - centered Views Notice that none of the above arguments for supernaturalism appeals to the prospect of eternal life (at least not explicitly). Arguments that do make such an appeal are soul - centered, holding that meaning in life mainly comes from having an immortal, spiritual substance that is contiguous with one s body when it is alive and that will forever outlive its death. Some think of the afterlife in terms of one s soul entering a transcendent, spiritual realm (Heaven), while others conceive of one s soul getting reincarnated into another body on Earth. According to the extreme version, if one has a soul but fails to put it in the right state (or if one lacks a soul altogether), then one s life is meaningless. There are three prominent arguments for an extreme soul - based perspective. One argument, made famous by Leo Tolstoy, is the suggestion that for life to be meaningful something must be worth doing, that something is worth doing only if it will make a permanent difference to the world, and that making a permanent difference requires being immortal (see also Hanfling 1987, 22 24; Morris 1992, 26; Craig 1994). Critics most often appeal to counterexamples, suggesting for instance that it is surely worth your time and effort to help prevent people from suffering, even if you and they are mortal. Indeed, some have gone on the offensive and argued that helping people is worth the sacrifice only if and because they are mortal, for otherwise they could invariably be compensated in an afterlife (e.g., Wielenberg 2005, 91 94). Another recent and interesting criticism is that the major motivations for the claim that nothing matters now if one day it will end are incoherent (Greene 2021). A second argument for the view that life would be meaningless without a soul is that it is necessary for justice to be done, which, in turn, is necessary for a meaningful life. Life seems nonsensical when the wicked flourish and the righteous suffer, at least supposing there is no other world in which these injustices will be rectified, whether by God or a Karmic force. Something like this argument can be found in Ecclesiastes, and it continues to be defended (e.g., Davis 1987; Craig 1994). However, even granting that an afterlife is required for perfectly just outcomes, it is far from obvious that an eternal afterlife is necessary for them, and, then, there is the suggestion that some lives, such as Mandela s, have been meaningful precisely in virtue of encountering injustice and fighting it. A third argument for thinking that having a soul is essential for any meaning is that it is required to have the sort of free will without which our lives would be meaningless. Immanuel Kant is known for having maintained that if we were merely physical beings, subjected to the laws of nature like everything else in the material world, then we could not act for moral reasons and hence would be unimportant. More recently, one theologian has eloquently put the point in religious terms:  The moral spirit finds the meaning of life in choice. It finds it in that which proceeds from man and remains with him as his inner essence rather than in the accidents of circumstances turns of external fortune...(W)henever a human being rubs the lamp of his moral conscience, a Spirit does appear. This Spirit is God... It is in the  Thou must  of God and man s  I can  that the divine image of God in human life is contained  (Swenson 1949 2000, 27 28). Notice that, even if moral norms did not spring from God s commands, the logic of the argument entails that one s life could be meaningful, so long as one had the inherent ability to make the morally correct choice in any situation. That, in turn, arguably requires something non - physical about one s self, so as to be able to overcome whichever physical laws and forces one might confront. The standard objection to this reasoning is to advance a compatibilism about having a determined physical nature and being able to act for moral reasons (e.g., Arpaly 2006; Fischer 2009, 145 77). It is also worth wondering whether, if one had to have a spiritual essence in order to make free choices, it would have to be one that never perished. Like God - centered theorists, many soul - centered theorists these days advance a moderate view, accepting that some meaning in life would be possible without immortality, but arguing that a much greater meaning would be possible with it. Granting that Einstein, Mandela, and Picasso had somewhat meaningful lives despite not having survived the deaths of their bodies (as per, e.g., Trisel 2004; Wolf 2015, 89 140; Landau 2017), there remains a powerful thought: more is better. If a finite life with the good, the true, and the beautiful has meaning in it to some degree, then surely it would have all the more meaning if it exhibited such higher values  including a relationship with God  for an eternity (Cottingham 2016, 132 35; Mawson 2016, 2019, 52 53; Williams 2020, 112 34; cf. Benatar 2017, 35 63). One objection to this reasoning is that the infinity of meaning that would be possible with a soul would be  too big,  rendering it difficult for the moderate supernaturalist to make sense of the intution that a finite life such as Einstein s can indeed count as meaningful by comparison (Metz 2019, 30 31; cf. Mawson 2019, 53 54). More common, though, is the objection that an eternal life would include anti - meaning of various kinds, such as boredom and repetition, discussed below in the context of extreme naturalism (sub - section 3.3). 3. Naturalism Recall that naturalism is the view that a physical life is central to life s meaning, that even if there is no spiritual realm, a substantially meaningful life is possible. Like supernaturalism, contemporary naturalism admits of two distinguishable variants, moderate and extreme (Metz 2019). The moderate version is that, while a genuinely meaningful life could be had in a purely physical universe as known well by science, a somewhat more meaningful life would be possible if a spiritual realm also existed. God or a soul could enhance meaning in life, although they would not be major contributors. The extreme version of naturalism is the view that it would be better in respect of life s meaning if there were no spiritual realm. From this perspective, God or a soul would be anti - matter, i.e., would detract from the meaning available to us, making a purely physical world (even if not this particular one) preferable. Cross - cutting the moderate extreme distinction is that between subjectivism and objectivism, which are theoretical accounts of the nature of meaningfulness insofar as it is physical. They differ in terms of the extent to which the human mind constitutes meaning and whether there are conditions of meaning that are invariant among human beings. Subjectivists believe that there are no invariant standards of meaning because meaning is relative to the subject, i.e., depends on an individual s pro - attitudes such as her particular desires or ends, which are not shared by everyone. Roughly, something is meaningful for a person if she strongly wants it or intends to seek it out and she gets it. Objectivists maintain, in contrast, that there are some invariant standards for meaning because meaning is at least partly mind - independent, i.e., obtains not merely in virtue of being the object of anyone s mental states. Here, something is meaningful (partially) because of its intrinsic nature, in the sense of being independent of whether it is wanted or intended; meaning is instead (to some extent) the sort of thing that merits these reactions. There is logical space for an orthogonal view, according to which there are invariant standards of meaningfulness constituted by what all human beings would converge on from a certain standpoint. However, it has not been much of a player in the field (Darwall 1983, 164 66). 3.1. Subjectivism According to this version of naturalism, meaning in life varies from person to person, depending on each one s variable pro - attitudes. Common instances are views that one s life is more meaningful, the more one gets what one happens to want strongly, achieves one s highly ranked goals, or does what one believes to be really important (Trisel 2002; Hooker 2008). One influential subjectivist has recently maintained that the relevant mental state is caring or loving, so that life is meaningful just to the extent that one cares about or loves something (Frankfurt 1988, 80 94, 2004). Another recent proposal is that meaningfulness consists of  an active engagement and affirmation that vivifies the person who has freely created or accepted and now promotes and nurtures the projects of her highest concern  (Belliotti 2019, 183). Subjectivism was dominant in the middle of the twentieth century, when positivism, noncognitivism, existentialism, and Humeanism were influential (Ayer 1947; Hare 1957; Barnes 1967; Taylor 1970; Williams 1976). However, in the last quarter of the twentieth century, inference to the best explanation and reflective equilibrium became accepted forms of normative argumentation and were frequently used to defend claims about the existence and nature of objective value (or of  external reasons,  ones obtaining independently of one s extant attitudes). As a result, subjectivism about meaning lost its dominance. Those who continue to hold subjectivism often remain suspicious of attempts to justify beliefs about objective value (e.g., Trisel 2002, 73, 79, 2004, 378 79; Frankfurt 2004, 47 48, 55 57; Wong 2008, 138 39; Evers 2017, 32, 36; Svensson 2017, 54). Theorists are moved to accept subjectivism typically because the alternatives are unpalatable; they are reasonably sure that meaning in life obtains for some people, but do not see how it could be grounded on something independent of the mind, whether it be the natural or the supernatural (or the non - natural). In contrast to these possibilities, it appears straightforward to account for what is meaningful in terms of what people find meaningful or what people want out of their lives. Wide - ranging meta - ethical debates in epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of language are necessary to address this rationale for subjectivism. There is a cluster of other, more circumscribed arguments for subjectivism, according to which this theory best explains certain intuitive features of meaning in life. For one, subjectivism seems plausible since it is reasonable to think that a meaningful life is an authentic one (Frankfurt 1988, 80 94). If a person s life is significant insofar as she is true to herself or her deepest nature, then we have some reason to believe that meaning simply is a function of those matters for which the person cares. For another, it is uncontroversial that often meaning comes from losing oneself, i.e., in becoming absorbed in an activity or experience, as opposed to being bored by it or finding it frustrating (Frankfurt 1988, 80 94; Belliotti 2019, 162 70). Work that concentrates the mind and relationships that are engrossing seem central to meaning and to be so because of the subjective elements involved. For a third, meaning is often taken to be something that makes life worth continuing for a specific person, i.e., that gives her a reason to get out of bed in the morning, which subjectivism is thought to account for best (Williams 1976; Svensson 2017; Calhoun 2018). Critics maintain that these arguments are vulnerable to a common objection: they neglect the role of objective value (or an external reason) in realizing oneself, losing oneself, and having a reason to live (Taylor 1989, 1992; Wolf 2010, 2015, 89 140). One is not really being true to oneself, losing oneself in a meaningful way, or having a genuine reason to live insofar as one, say, successfully maintains 3,732 hairs on one s head (Taylor 1992, 36), cultivates one s prowess at long - distance spitting (Wolf 2010, 104), collects a big ball of string (Wolf 2010, 104), or, well, eats one s own excrement (Wielenberg 2005, 22). The counterexamples suggest that subjective conditions are insufficient to ground meaning in life; there seem to be certain actions, relationships, and states that are objectively valuable (but see Evers 2017, 30 32) and toward which one s pro - attitudes ought to be oriented, if meaning is to accrue. So say objectivists, but subjectivists feel the pull of the point and usually seek to avoid the counterexamples, lest they have to bite the bullet by accepting the meaningfulness of maintaining 3,732 hairs on one s head and all the rest (for some who do, see Svensson 2017, 54 55; Belliotti 2019, 181 83). One important strategy is to suggest that subjectivists can avoid the counterexamples by appealing to the right sort of pro - attitude. Instead of whatever an individual happens to want, perhaps the relevant mental state is an emotional - perceptual one of seeing - as (Alexis 2011; cf. Hosseini 2015, 47 66), a  categorical  desire, that is, an intrinsic desire constitutive of one s identity that one takes to make life worth continuing (Svensson 2017), or a judgment that one has a good reason to value something highly for its own sake (Calhoun 2018). Even here, though, objectivists will argue that it might  appear that whatever the will chooses to treat as a good reason to engage itself is, for the will, a good reason. But the will itself...craves objective reasons; and often it could not go forward unless it thought it had them  (Wiggins 1988, 136). And without any appeal to objectivity, it is perhaps likely that counterexamples would resurface. Another subjectivist strategy by which to deal with the counterexamples is the attempt to ground meaningfulness, not on the pro - attitudes of an individual valuer, but on those of a group (Darwall 1983, 164 66; Brogaard and Smith 2005; Wong 2008). Does such an intersubjective move avoid (more of) the counterexamples? If so, does it do so more plausibly than an objective theory? 3.2. Objectivism Objective naturalists believe that meaning in life is constituted at least in part by something physical beyond merely the fact that it is the object of a pro - attitude. Obtaining the object of some emotion, desire, or judgment is not sufficient for meaningfulness, on this view. Instead, there are certain conditions of the material world that could confer meaning on anyone s life, not merely because they are viewed as meaningful, wanted for their own sake, or believed to be choiceworthy, but instead (at least partially) because they are inherently worthwhile or valuable in themselves. Morality (the good), enquiry (the true), and creativity (the beautiful) are widely held instances of activities that confer meaning on life, while trimming toenails and eating snow  along with the counterexamples to subjectivism above  are not. Objectivism is widely thought to be a powerful general explanation of these particular judgments: the former are meaningful not merely because some agent (whether it is an individual, her society, or even God) cares about them or judges them to be worth doing, while the latter simply lack significance and cannot obtain it even if some agent does care about them or judge them to be worth doing. From an objective perspective, it is possible for an individual to care about the wrong thing or to be mistaken that something is worthwhile, and not merely because of something she cares about all the more or judges to be still more choiceworthy. Of course, meta - ethical debates about the existence and nature of value are again relevant to appraising this rationale. Some objectivists think that being the object of a person s mental states plays no constitutive role in making that person s life meaningful, although they of course contend that it often plays an instrumental role  liking a certain activity, after all, is likely to motivate one to do it. Relatively few objectivists are  pure  in that way, although consequentialists do stand out as clear instances (e.g., Singer 1995; Smuts 2018, 75 99). Most objectivists instead try to account for the above intuitions driving subjectivism by holding that a life is more meaningful, not merely because of objective factors, but also in part because of propositional attitudes such as cognition, conation, and emotion. Particularly influential has been Susan Wolf s hybrid view, captured by this pithy slogan:  Meaning arises when subjective attraction meets objective attractiveness  (Wolf 2015, 112; see also Kekes 1986, 2000; Wiggins 1988; Raz 2001, 10 40; Mintoff 2008; Wolf 2010, 2016; Fischer 2019, 9 23; Belshaw 2021, 160 81). This theory implies that no meaning accrues to one s life if one believes in, is satisfied by, or cares about a project that is not truly worthwhile, or if one takes up a truly worthwhile project but fails to judge it important, be satisfied by it, or care about it. A related approach is that, while subjective attraction is not necessary for meaning, it could enhance it (e.g., Audi 2005, 344; Metz 2013, 183 84, 196 98, 220 25). For instance, a stereotypical Mother Teresa who is bored by and alienated from her substantial charity work might have a somewhat significant existence because of it, even if she would have an even more significant existence if she felt pride in it or identified with it. There have been several attempts to capture theoretically what all objectively attractive, inherently worthwhile, or finally valuable conditions have in common insofar as they bear on meaning in a person s life. Over the past few decades, one encounters the proposals that objectively meaningful conditions are just those that involve: positively connecting with organic unity beyond oneself (Nozick 1981, 594 619); being creative (Taylor 1987; Matheson 2018); living an emotional life (Solomon 1993; cf. Williams 2020, 56 78); promoting good consequences, such as improving the quality of life of oneself and others (Singer 1995; Audi 2005; Smuts 2018, 75 99); exercising or fostering rational nature in exceptional ways (Smith 1997, 179 221; Gewirth 1998, 177 82; Metz 2013, 222 36); progressing toward ends that can never be fully realized because one s knowledge of them changes as one approaches them (Levy 2005); realizing goals that are transcendent for being long - lasting in duration and broad in scope (Mintoff 2008); living virtuously (May 2015, 61 138; McPherson 2020); and loving what is worth loving (Wolf 2016). There is as yet no convergence in the field on one, or even a small cluster, of these accounts. One feature of a large majority of the above naturalist theories is that they are aggregative or additive, objectionably treating a life as a mere  container  of bits of life that are meaningful considered in isolation from other bits (Br nnmark 2003, 330). It has become increasingly common for philosophers of life s meaning, especially objectivists, to hold that life as a whole, or at least long stretches of it, can substantially affect its meaningfulness beyond the amount of meaning (if any) in its parts. For instance, a life that has lots of beneficence and otherwise intuitively meaning - conferring conditions but that is also extremely repetitive (  la the movie Groundhog Day) is less than maximally meaningful (Taylor 1987; Blumenfeld 2009). Furthermore, a life that not only avoids repetition but also ends with a substantial amount of meaningful (or otherwise desirable) parts seems to have more meaning overall than one that has the same amount of meaningful (desirable) parts but ends with few or none of them (Kamm 2013, 18 22; Dorsey 2015). Still more, a life in which its meaningless (or otherwise undesirable parts) cause its meaningful (desirable) parts to come about through a process of personal growth seems meaningful in virtue of this redemptive pattern,  good life - story,  or narrative self - expression (Taylor 1989, 48 51; Wong 2008; Fischer 2009, 145 77; Kauppinen 2012; May 2015, 61 138; Velleman 2015, 141 73). These three cases suggest that meaning can inhere in life as a whole, that is, in the relationships between its parts, and not merely in the parts considered in isolation. However, some would maintain that it is, strictly speaking, the story that is or could be told of a life that matters, not so much the life - story qua relations between events themselves (de Bres 2018). There are pure or extreme versions of holism present in the literature, according to which the only possible bearer of meaning in life is a person s life as a whole, and not any isolated activities, relationships, or states (Taylor 1989, 48 51; Tabensky 2003; Levinson 2004). A salient argument for this position is that judgments of the meaningfulness of a part of someone s life are merely provisional, open to revision upon considering how they fit into a wider perspective. So, for example, it would initially appear that taking an ax away from a madman and thereby protecting innocent parties confers some meaning on one s life, but one might well revise that judgment upon learning that the intention behind it was merely to steal an ax, not to save lives, or that the madman then took out a machine gun, causing much more harm than his ax would have. It is worth considering how far this sort of case is generalizable, and, if it can be to a substantial extent, whether that provides strong evidence that only life as a whole can exhibit meaningfulness. Perhaps most objectivists would, at least upon reflection, accept that both the parts of a life and the whole - life relationships among the parts can exhibit meaning. Supposing there are two bearers of meaning in a life, important questions arise. One is whether a certain narrative can be meaningful even if its parts are not, while a second is whether the meaningfulness of a part increases if it is an aspect of a meaningful whole (on which see Br nnmark 2003), and a third is whether there is anything revealing to say about how to make tradeoffs between the parts and whole in cases where one must choose between them (Blumenfeld 2009 appears to assign lexical priority to the whole). 3.3. Rejecting God and a Soul Naturalists until recently had been largely concerned to show that meaning in life is possible without God or a soul; they have not spent much time considering how such spiritual conditions might enhance meaning, but have, in moderate fashion, tended to leave that possibility open (an exception is Hooker 2008). Lately, however, an extreme form of naturalism has arisen, according to which our lives would probably, if not unavoidably, have less meaning in a world with God or a soul than in one without. Although such an approach was voiced early on by Baier (1957), it is really in the past decade or so that this  anti - theist  position has become widely and intricately discussed. One rationale, mentioned above as an objection to the view that God s purpose constitutes meaning in life, has also been deployed to argue that the existence of God as such would necessarily reduce meaning, that is, would consist of anti - matter. It is the idea that master servant and parent child analogies so prominent in the monotheist religious traditions reveal something about our status in a world where there is a qualitatively higher being who has created us with certain ends in mind: our independence or dignity as adult persons would be violated (e.g., Baier 1957 2000, 118 20; Kahane 2011, 681 85; Lougheed 2020, 121 41). One interesting objection to this reasoning has been to accept that God s existence is necessarily incompatible with the sort of meaning that would come (roughly stated) from being one s own boss, but to argue that God would also make greater sorts of meaning available, offering a net gain to us (Mawson 2016, 110 58). Another salient argument for thinking that God would detract from meaning in life appeals to the value of privacy (Kahane 2011, 681 85; Lougheed 2020, 55 110). God s omniscience would unavoidably make it impossible for us to control another person s access to the most intimate details about ourselves, which, for some, amounts to a less meaningful life than one with such control. Beyond questioning the value of our privacy in relation to God, one thought - provoking criticism has been to suggest that, if a lack of privacy really would substantially reduce meaning in our lives, then God, qua morally perfect person, would simply avoid knowing everything about us (Tooley 2018). Lacking complete knowledge of our mental states would be compatible with describing God as  omniscient,  so the criticism goes, insofar as that is plausibly understood as having as much knowledge as is morally permissible. Turn, now, to major arguments for thinking that having a soul would reduce life s meaning, so that if one wants a maximally meaningful life, one should prefer a purely physical world, or at least one in which people are mortal. First and foremost, there has been the argument that an immortal life could not avoid becoming boring (Williams 1973), rendering life pointless according to many subjective and objective theories. The literature on this topic has become enormous, with the central reply being that immortality need not get boring (for more recent discussions, see Fischer 2009, 79 101, 2019, 117 42; Mawson 2019, 51 52; Williams 2020, 30 41, 123 29; Belshaw 2021, 182 97). However, it might also be worth questioning whether boredom is sufficient for meaninglessness. Suppose, for instance, that one volunteers to be bored so that many others will not be bored; perhaps this would be a meaningful sacrifice to make. Being bored for an eternity would not be blissful or even satisfying, to be sure, but if it served the function of preventing others from being bored for an eternity, would it be meaningful (at least to some degree)? If, as is commonly held, sacrificing one s life could be meaningful, why not also sacrificing one s liveliness? Another reason given to reject eternal life is that it would become repetitive, which would substantially drain it of meaning (Scarre 2007, 54 55; May 2009, 46 47, 64 65, 71; Smuts 2011, 142 44; cf. Blumenfeld 2009). If, as it appears, there are only a finite number of actions one could perform, relationships one could have, and states one could be in during an eternity, one would have to end up doing the same things again. Even though one s activities might be more valuable than rolling a stone up a hill forever   la Sisyphus, the prospect of doing them over and over again forever is disheartening for many. To be sure, one might not remember having done them before and hence could avoid boredom, but for some philosophers that would make it all the worse, akin to having dementia and forgetting that one has told the same stories. Others, however, still find meaning in such a life (e.g., Belshaw 2021, 197, 205 n 41). A third meaning - based argument against immortality invokes considerations of narrative. If the pattern of one s life as a whole substantially matters, and if a proper pattern would include a beginning, a middle, and an end, it appears that a life that never ends would lack the relevant narrative structure. Because it would drag on endlessly, it would, sooner or later, just be a string of events lacking all form... With immortality, the novel never ends... How meaningful can such a novel be?  (May 2009, 68, 72; see also Scarre 2007, 58 60). Notice that this objection is distinct from considerations of boredom and repetition (which concern novelty); even if one were stimulated and active, and even if one found a way not to repeat one s life in the course of eternity, an immortal life would appear to lack shape. In reply, some reject the idea that a meaningful life must be akin to a novel, and intead opt for narrativity in the form of something like a string of short stories that build on each other (Fischer 2009, 145 77, 2019, 101 16). Others, though, have sought to show that eternity could still be novel - like, deeming the sort of ending that matters to be a function of what the content is and how it relates to the content that came before (e.g., Seachris 2011; Williams 2020, 112 19). There have been additional objections to immortality as undercutting meaningfulness, but they are prima facie less powerful than the previous three in that, if sound, they arguably show that an eternal life would have a cost, but probably not one that would utterly occlude the prospect of meaning in it. For example, there have been the suggestions that eternal lives would lack a sense of preciousness and urgency (Nussbaum 1989, 339; Kass 2002, 266 67), could not exemplify virtues such as courageously risking one s life for others (Kass 2002, 267 68; Wielenberg 2005, 91 94), and could not obtain meaning from sustaining or saving others  lives (Nussbaum 1989, 338; Wielenberg 2005, 91 94). Note that at least the first two rationales turn substantially on the belief in immortality, not quite immortality itself: if one were immortal but forgot that one is or did not know that at all, then one could appreciate life and obtain much of the virtue of courage (and, conversely, if one were not immortal, but thought that one is, then, by the logic of these arguments, one would fail to appreciate limits and be unable to exemplify courage). 4. Nihilism The previous two sections addressed theoretical accounts of what would confer meaning on a human person s life. Although these theories do not imply that some people s lives are in fact meaningful, that has been the presumption of a very large majority of those who have advanced them. Much of the procedure has been to suppose that many lives have had meaning in them and then to consider in virtue of what they have or otherwise could. However, there are nihilist (or pessimist) perspectives that question this supposition. According to nihilism (pessimism), what would make a life meaningful in principle cannot obtain for any of us. One straightforward rationale for nihilism is the combination of extreme supernaturalism about what makes life meaningful and atheism about whether a spiritual realm exists. If you believe that God or a soul is necessary for meaning in life, and if you believe that neither is real, then you are committed to nihilism, to the denial that life can have any meaning. Athough this rationale for nihilism was prominent in the modern era (and was more or less Camus  position), it has been on the wane in analytic philosophical circles, as extreme supernaturalism has been eclipsed by the moderate variety. The most common rationales for nihilism these days do not appeal to supernaturalism, or at least not explicitly. One cluster of ideas appeals to what meta - ethicists call  error theory,  the view that evaluative claims (in this case about meaning in life, or about morality qua necessary for meaning) characteristically posit objectively real or universally justified values, but that such values do not exist. According to one version, value judgments often analytically include a claim to objectivity but there is no reason to think that objective values exist, as they  would be entities or qualities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly different from anything else in the universe  (Mackie 1977 1990, 38). According to a second version, life would be meaningless if there were no set of moral standards that could be fully justified to all rational enquirers, but it so happens that such standards cannot exist for persons who can always reasonably question a given claim (Murphy 1982, 12 17). According to a third, we hold certain beliefs about the objectivity and universality of morality and related values such as meaning because they were evolutionarily advantageous to our ancestors, not because they are true. Humans have been  deceived by their genes into thinking that there is a distinterested, objective morality binding upon them, which all should obey  (Ruse and Wilson 1986, 179; cf. Street 2015). One must draw on the intricate work in meta - ethics that has been underway for the past several decades in order to appraise these arguments. In contrast to error - theoretic arguments for nihilism, there are rationales for it accepting that objective values exist but denying that our lives can ever exhibit or promote them so as to obtain meaning. One version of this approach maintains that, for our lives to matter, we must be in a position to add objective value to the world, which we are not since the objective value of the world is already infinite (Smith 2003). The key premises for this view are that every bit of space - time (or at least the stars in the physical universe) have some positive value, that these values can be added up, and that space is infinite. If the physical world at present contains an infinite degree of value, nothing we do can make a difference in terms of meaning, for infinity plus any amount of value remains infinity. One way to question this argument, beyond doubting the value of space - time or stars, is to suggest that, even if one cannot add to the value of the universe, meaning plausibly comes from being the source of certain values. A second rationale for nihilism that accepts the existence of objective value is David Benatar s (2006, 18 59) intriguing  asymmetry argument  for anti - natalism, the view that it is immoral to bring new people into existence because doing so would always be on balance bad for them. For Benatar, the bads of existing (e.g., pains) are real disadvantages relative to not existing, while the goods of existing (pleasures) are not real advantages relative to not existing, since there is in the latter state no one to be deprived of them. If indeed the state of not existing is no worse than that of experiencing the benefits of existence, then, since existing invariably brings harm in its wake, it follows that existing is always worse compared to not existing. Although this argument is illustrated with experiential goods and bads, it seems generalizable to non - experiential ones, including meaning in life and anti - matter. The literature on this argument has become large (for a recent collection, see Hauskeller and Hallich 2022). Benatar (2006, 60 92, 2017, 35 63) has advanced an additional argument for nihilism, one that appeals to Thomas Nagel s (1986, 208 32) widely discussed analysis of the extremely external standpoint that human persons can take on their lives. There exists, to use Henry Sidgwick s influential phrase, the  point of view of the universe,  that is, the standpoint that considers a human being s life in relation to all times and all places. When one takes up this most external standpoint and views one s puny impact on the world, little of one s life appears to matter. What one does in a certain society on Earth over 75 years or so just does not amount to much, when considering the billions of temporal years and billions of light - years that make up space - time. Although this reasoning grants limited kinds of meaning to human beings, from a personal, social, or human perspective, Benatar both denies that the greatest sort of meaning  a cosmic one  is available to them and contends that this makes their lives bad, hence the  nihilist  tag. Some have objected that our lives could in fact have a cosmic significance, say, if they played a role in God s plan (Quinn 2000, 65 66; Swinburne 2016, 154), were the sole ones with a dignity in the universe (Kahane 2014), or engaged in valuable activities that could be appreciated by anyone anywhere anytime (Wolf 2016, 261 62). Others naturally maintain that cosmic significance is irrelevant to appraising a human life, with some denying that it would be a genuine source of meaning (Landau 2017, 93 99), and others accepting that it would be but maintaining that the absence of this good would not count as a bad or merit regret (discussed in Benatar 2017, 56 62; Williams 2020, 108 11). Finally, a distinguishable source of nihilism concerns the ontological, as distinct from axiological, preconditions for meaning in life. Perhaps most radically, there are those who deny that we have selves. Do we indeed lack selves, and, if we do, is a meaningful life impossible for us (see essays in Caruso and Flanagan 2018; Le Bihan 2019)? Somewhat less radically, there are those who grant that we have selves, but deny that they are in charge in the relevant way. That is, some have argued that we lack self - governance or free will of the sort that is essential for meaning in life, at least if determinism is true (Pisciotta 2013; essays in Caruso and Flanagan 2018). Non - quantum events, including human decisions, appear to be necessited by a prior state of the world, such that none could have been otherwise, and many of our decisions are a product of unconscious neurological mechanisms (while quantum events are of course utterly beyond our control). If none of our conscious choices could have been avoided and all were ultimately necessited by something external to them, perhaps they are insufficient to merit pride or admiration or to constitute narrative authorship of a life. In reply, some maintain that a compatibilism between determinism and moral responsibility applies with comparable force to meaning in life (e.g., Arpaly 2006; Fischer 2009, 145 77), while others contend that incompatibilism is true of moral responsibility but not of meaning (Pereboom 2014).

    "ai_overview": "Different philosophical traditions approach the meaning of life from diverse perspectives. Here's a summary of some key viewpoints:\n* **Ancient Greek Philosophy:**\n* **Platonism:** The meaning of life is in attaining the highest form of knowledge, the Idea of the Good, from which all good and just things derive utility and value.\n* **Aristotelianism:** Achieving eudaimonia, often translated as happiness, well-being, flourishing, and excellence, is the highest good.\n* **Cynicism:** Living a life of virtue in agreement with nature is the purpose of life. Happiness depends on self-sufficiency and control over one's mental attitude.\n* **Cyrenaicism:** Pleasure is the supreme good.\n* **Epicureanism:** Seeking modest pleasures to attain tranquility and freedom from fear (ataraxia). Freedom from pain and fear is happiness in its highest form.\n* **Stoicism:** Living according to reason and virtue is to be in harmony with the universe's divine order. Meaning is \"freedom from suffering\" through objectivity and clear judgment.\n* **Enlightenment Philosophy:** Focuses on the relationship between individuals and their society, emphasizing natural rights and the potentialities of reason.\n* **Kantianism:** Adhering to the categorical imperative and acting in accordance with duty.\n* **19th-Century Philosophy:**\n* **Utilitarianism:** The meaning of life is the \"greatest happiness principle,\" aiming to bring the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people.\n* **Nihilism:** Life is without objective meaning, a concept that Friedrich Nietzsche explored, suggesting it should be overcome by creating new values.\n* **20th-Century Philosophy:**\n* **Pragmatism:** The practical and useful understanding of life is more important than searching for an impractical abstract truth.\n* **Theism:** Meaning and purpose are found in God's purpose in creating the universe and humanity.\n* **Existentialism:** Each person creates the essence of their life. Ethical directives are action, freedom, and decision.\n* **Absurdism:** Acceptance of the Absurd and continuing to live in spite of it.\n* **Secular Humanism:** Values and realities are derived from human need and interest as tested by experience.\n* **Logical Positivism:** The question \"What is the meaning of life?\" is meaningless because it is a misuse of language.\n* **East Asian Philosophical Perspectives:**\n* **Mohism:** The purpose of life is universal, impartial love.\n* **Confucianism:** Achieving virtue through strong relationships and reasoning while minimizing negative influences.\n* **Taoism: All sentient beings and all men should return to the primordial or to rejoin with the Oneness of the Universe by self-cultivation and self-realization.\n* **Religious Perspectives:**\n* **Judaism:** Elevating the physical world and preparing it for the messianic era through adherence to God's laws and ethical actions.\n* **Christianity:** Seeking divine salvation through faith in God and the intercession of Christ.\n* **Islam:** Worshipping Allah, following divine guidelines revealed in the Qur'an, and acting righteously to attain closeness to Allah in the afterlife.\n* **Hinduism:** Tied to karma, samsara (the cycle of birth and rebirth), and moksha (liberation).\n* **Jainism:** Achieving self-realization and bliss through self-conquest and freedom from external objects.\n* **Buddhism:** Ending suffering and achieving Nirvana through embracing mindfulness and seeing the causes of ill-being and well-being.\n* **Sikhism:** Understanding God and discovering the divinity within each individual.\n* **Zoroastrianism:** Actively participating in the universal conflict between good and evil with good thoughts, words, and deeds.",

For the work by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, see Coleridge's theory of life. For other uses, see Meaning of Life (disambiguation). The meaning of life is the concept of an individual's life, or existence in general, having an inherent significance or a philosophical point. There is no consensus on the specifics of such a concept or whether the concept itself even exists in any objective sense. Thinking and discourse on the topic is sought in the English language through questions such as but not limited to \"What is the meaning of life?\", \"What is the purpose of existence?\", and \"Why are we here?\". There have been many proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds. The search for life's meaning has produced much philosophical, scientific, theological, and metaphysical speculation throughout history. Different people and cultures believe different things for the answer to this question. Opinions vary on the usefulness of using time and resources in the pursuit of an answer. Excessive pondering can be indicative of, or lead to, an existential crisis. The meaning of life can be derived from philosophical and religious contemplation of, and scientific inquiries about, existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness. Many other issues are also involved, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will, the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife. Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe, exploring the context and parameters concerning the \"how\" of life. Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well - being and a related conception of morality. An alternative, humanistic approach poses the question, \"What is the meaning of my life?\" .mw - parser - output .toclimit - 2 .toclevel - 1 ul,.mw - parser - output .toclimit - 3 .toclevel - 2 ul,.mw - parser - output .toclimit - 4 .toclevel - 3 ul,.mw - parser - output .toclimit - 5 .toclevel - 4 ul,.mw - parser - output .toclimit - 6 .toclevel - 5 ul,.mw - parser - output .toclimit - 7 .toclevel - 6 ul display:none  Origin of the expression The first English use of the expression \"meaning of life\" appears in Thomas Carlyle's Sartor Resartus (1833 1834), book II chapter IX, \"The Everlasting Yea\". 1  Our Life is compassed round with Necessity; yet is the meaning of Life itself no other than Freedom, than Voluntary Force: thus have we a warfare; in the beginning, especially, a hard - fought battle. 2 Carlyle may have been inspired by earlier usage of the equivalent German expression der Sinn des Lebens by German Romantic writers Novalis and Friedrich Schlegel. Schlegel was the first to use it in print by way of his novel Lucinde (1799), though Novalis had done so in a 1797 1798 manuscript, in which he wrote: \"Only an artist can divine the meaning of life.\" Additionally, the word lebenssinn, translated as life's meaning, had been used by Goethe in a 1796 letter to Schiller. 3  These authors grappled with the rationalism and materialism of modernity. Carlyle called this the \"Torch of Science\", which burned \"more fiercely than ever\" and made religion \"all parched away, under the Droughts of practical and spiritual Unbelief\", resulting in the \"Wilderness\" of \"the wide World in an Atheistic Century\". 4  Origin of the question Socrates Arthur Schopenhauer was the first to explicitly ask the question, 1  in an essay entitled \"Character\". Since a man does not alter, and his moral character remains absolutely the same all through his life; since he must play out the part which he has received, without the least deviation from the character; since neither experience, nor philosophy, nor religion can effect any improvement in him, the question arises, What is the meaning of life at all? To what purpose is it played, this farce in which everything that is essential is irrevocably fixed and determined? 5 Questions about the meaning of life, and similar, have been expressed in a broad variety of other ways, including: What is the meaning of life? What's it all about? Who are we? 6  7  8  Why are we here? What are we here for? 9  10  11  What is the origin of life? 12  What is the nature of life? What is the nature of reality? 12  13  14  What is the purpose of life? What is the purpose of one's life? 13  15  16  What is the significance of life? 16  (See also  Psychological significance and value in life) What is meaningful and valuable in life? 17  What is the value of life? 18  What is the reason to live? What are we living for? 11  19  These questions have resulted in a wide range of competing answers and explications, from scientific theories, to philosophical, theological, and spiritual explanations. Scientific inquiry and perspectives Further information: Eudaimonia   Eudaimonia and modern psychology, and Meaningful Life Many members of the scientific community and philosophy of science communities think that science can provide the relevant context, and set of parameters necessary for dealing with topics related to the meaning of life. In their view, science can offer a wide range of insights on topics ranging from the science of happiness to death anxiety. Scientific inquiry facilitates this through nomological investigation into various aspects of life and reality, such as the Big Bang, the origin of life, and evolution, and by studying the objective factors which correlate with the subjective experience of meaning and happiness. Psychological significance and value in life Researchers in positive psychology study empirical factors that lead to life satisfaction, 20  full engagement in activities, 21  making a fuller contribution by using one's personal strengths, 22  and meaning based on investing in something larger than the self. 23  Large - data studies of flow experiences have consistently suggested that humans experience meaning and fulfillment when mastering challenging tasks and that the experience comes from the way tasks are approached and performed rather than the particular choice of task. For example, flow experiences can be obtained by prisoners in concentration camps with minimal facilities, and occur only slightly more often in billionaires. A classic example 21  is of two workers on an apparently boring production line in a factory. One treats the work as a tedious chore while the other turns it into a game to see how fast they can make each unit and achieves flow in the process. Neuroscience describes reward, pleasure, and motivation in terms of neurotransmitter activity, especially in the limbic system and the ventral tegmental area in particular. If one believes that the meaning of life is to maximize pleasure and to ease general life, then this allows normative predictions about how to act to achieve this. Likewise, some ethical naturalists advocate a science of morality the empirical pursuit of flourishing for all conscious creatures. Experimental philosophy and neuroethics research collects data about human ethical decisions in controlled scenarios such as trolley problems. It has shown that many types of ethical judgment are universal across cultures, suggesting that they may be innate, whilst others are culture - specific. The findings show actual human ethical reasoning to be at odds with most philosophical theories, for example consistently showing distinctions between action by cause and action by omission which would be absent from utility - based theories. Cognitive science has theorized about differences between conservative and liberal ethics and how they may be based on different metaphors from family life such as strong fathers vs nurturing mother models. Neurotheology is a controversial field which tries to find neural correlates and mechanisms of religious experience. Some researchers have suggested that the human brain has innate mechanisms for such experiences and that living without using them for their evolved purposes may be a cause of imbalance. Studies have reported conflicting results on correlating happiness with religious belief and it is difficult to find unbiased meta - analyses. 24  25  Sociology examines value at a social level using theoretical constructs such as value theory, norms, anomie, etc. One value system suggested by social psychologists, broadly called Terror Management Theory, states that human meaning is derived from a fundamental fear of death, and values are selected when they allow us to escape the mental reminder of death. Alongside this, there are a number of theories about the way in which humans evaluate the positive and negative aspects of their existence and thus the value and meaning they place on their lives. For example, depressive realism posits an exaggerated positivity in all except those experiencing depressive disorders who see life as it truly is, and David Benatar theorises that more weight is generally given to positive experiences, providing bias towards an over - optimistic view of life. Emerging research shows that meaning in life predicts better physical health outcomes. Greater meaning has been associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease, 26  27  reduced risk of heart attack among individuals with coronary heart disease, 28  reduced risk of stroke, 29  and increased longevity in both American and Japanese samples. 30  There is also growing evidence for a small decline in purpose in life in the early stages of cognitive impairment. 31  In 2014, the British National Health Service began recommending a five - step plan for mental well - being based on meaningful lives, whose steps are: 32  Connect with community and family Physical exercise Lifelong learning Giving to others Mindfulness of the world around you Origin and nature of biological life DNA contains the genetic instructions for the development and functioning of all known organisms. The exact mechanisms of abiogenesis are unknown: notable hypotheses include the RNA world hypothesis (RNA - based replicators) and the iron - sulfur world hypothesis (metabolism without genetics). The process by which different lifeforms have developed throughout history via genetic mutation and natural selection is explained by evolution. 33  At the end of the 20 th century, based upon insight gleaned from the gene - centered view of evolution, biologists George C. Williams, Richard Dawkins, and David Haig, among others, concluded that if there is a primary function to life, it is the replication of DNA and the survival of one's genes. 34  35  Responding to an interview question from Richard Dawkins about \"what it is all for\", James Watson stated \"I don't think we're for anything. We're just the products of evolution.\" 36  Though scientists have intensively studied life on Earth, defining life in unequivocal terms is still a challenge. 37  38  Physically, one may say that life \"feeds on negative entropy\" 39  40  41  which refers to the process by which living entities decrease their internal entropy at the expense of some form of energy taken in from the environment. 42  43  44  Biologists generally agree that lifeforms are self - organizing systems which regulate their internal environments as to maintain this organized state, metabolism serves to provide energy, and reproduction causes life to continue over a span of multiple generations. Typically, organisms are responsive to stimuli and genetic information changes from generation to generation, resulting in adaptation through evolution; this optimizes the chances of survival for the individual organism and its descendants respectively. 45  Non - cellular replicating agents, notably viruses, are generally not considered to be organisms because they are incapable of independent reproduction or metabolism. This classification is problematic, though, since some parasites and endosymbionts are also incapable of independent life. Astrobiology studies the possibility of different forms of life on other worlds, including replicating structures made from materials other than DNA. All forms of life that are in existence today possess a self - replicating informational molecule (genome), and such an informational molecule is presumably intrinsic to life. Thus the earliest forms of life also likely possessed a self - replicating informational molecule, possibly RNA 46  47  or perhaps an informational molecule more primitive than RNA. The specific genomic sequences in all currently extant organisms contain order generating information that promotes survival, reproduction, and the ability to acquire resources necessary for reproduction. Sequences with such basic functions probably emerged early in the evolution of life. It has been proposed 48  that both the evolution of macroscopic order in life (including its basic functions) and the evolution of order in particular physical systems obey a common fundamental principle that was termed the Darwinian dynamic. This principal was formulated by considering, first, how macroscopic order is generated in a simple physical, non - biological system far from thermodynamic equilibrium, and then extending consideration to short RNA replicating molecules and then further to more complex forms of life. It was concluded that the fundamental order - generating process was basically similar for both types of process. 48  49  Thus the idea that life likely emerged as a natural extension of simpler non - or pre - biological physical processes should logically be included in the concept \"meaning of life\". Origins and ultimate fate of the universe Modern view of the expansion of space. The inflationary epoch is a period of rapidly accelerating expansion at left. Though the Big Bang theory was met with much skepticism when first introduced, it has become well - supported by several independent observations. 50  However, current physics can only describe the early universe from around 10 43 seconds after the Big Bang (where zero time corresponds to infinite temperature); a theory of quantum gravity would be required to understand events before that time. Nevertheless, many physicists have speculated about what would have preceded this limit, and how the universe came into being. 51  For example, one interpretation is that the Big Bang occurred coincidentally, and when considering the anthropic principle, it is sometimes interpreted as implying the existence of a multiverse. 52  The ultimate fate of the universe, and implicitly of humanity, is hypothesized as one in which biological life will eventually become unsustainable, such as through a Big Freeze, Big Rip, or Big Crunch. Theoretical cosmology studies many alternative speculative models for the origin and fate of the universe beyond the Big Bang theory. A recent trend has been models of the creation of 'baby universes' inside black holes, with our own Big Bang being a white hole on the inside of a black hole in another parent universe. 53  Many - worlds theories claim that every possibility of quantum mechanics is played out in parallel universes. Scientific questions about the mind The nature and origin of consciousness and the mind are also widely debated in science. The explanatory gap is generally equated with the hard problem of consciousness, and the question of free will is also considered to be of fundamental importance. These subjects are mostly addressed in the fields of cognitive science, neuroscience (e.g. the neuroscience of free will) and philosophy of mind, though some evolutionary biologists and theoretical physicists have also made several allusions to the subject. 54  55  Reductionistic and eliminative materialistic approaches, for example the Multiple Drafts Model, hold that consciousness can be wholly explained by neuroscience through the workings of the brain and its neurons, thus adhering to biological naturalism. 55  56  57  On the other hand, some scientists, like Andrei Linde, have considered that consciousness, like spacetime, might have its own intrinsic degrees of freedom, and that one's perceptions may be as real as (or even more real than) material objects. 58  Hypotheses of consciousness and spacetime explain consciousness in describing a \"space of conscious elements\", 58  often encompassing a number of extra dimensions. 59  Electromagnetic theories of consciousness solve the binding problem of consciousness in saying that the electromagnetic field generated by the brain is the actual carrier of conscious experience; there is however disagreement about the implementations of such a theory relating to other workings of the mind. 60  61  Quantum mind theories use quantum theory in explaining certain properties of the mind. Explaining the process of free will through quantum phenomena is an alternative to determinism. Parapsychology Based on the premises of non - materialistic explanations of the mind, some have suggested the existence of a cosmic consciousness, asserting that consciousness is actually the \"ground of all being\". 14  62  63  Proponents of this view cite accounts of paranormal phenomena, primarily extrasensory perceptions and psychic powers, as evidence for an incorporeal higher consciousness. In hopes of proving the existence of these phenomena, parapsychologists have orchestrated various experiments, but successful results might be due to poor experimental controls and might have alternative explanations. 64  65  66  67  Nature of meaning in life Reker and Wong define personal meaning as the \"cognizance of order, coherence and purpose in one's existence, the pursuit and attainment of worthwhile goals, and an accompanying sense of fulfillment\" (p. 221). 68  In 2016, Martela and Steger defined meaning as coherence, purpose, and significance. 69  In contrast, Wong has proposed a four - component solution to the question of meaning in life, 70  71  with the four components purpose, understanding, responsibility, and enjoyment (PURE): You need to choose a worthy purpose or a significant life goal. You need to have sufficient understanding of who you are, what life demands of you, and how you can play a significant role in life. You and you alone are responsible for deciding what kind of life you want to live, and what constitutes a significant and worthwhile life goal. You will enjoy a deep sense of significance and satisfaction only when you have exercised your responsibility for self - determination and actively pursue a worthy life - goal. Thus, a sense of significance permeates every dimension of meaning, rather than standing as a separate factor. Although most psychology researchers consider meaning in life as a subjective feeling or judgment, most philosophers (e.g., Thaddeus Metz, Daniel Haybron) propose that there are also objective, concrete criteria for what constitutes meaning in life. 72  73  Wong has proposed that whether life is meaningful depends not only on subjective feelings but, more importantly, on whether a person's goal - striving and life as a whole is meaningful according to some objective normative standard. 71  Western philosophical perspectives The philosophical perspectives on the meaning of life are those ideologies that explain life in terms of ideals or abstractions defined by humans. Ancient Greek philosophy Plato and Aristotle in The School of Athens fresco by Raphael. Plato is pointing heavenwards, and Aristotle is gesturing to the world. Platonism Main article: Platonism Plato, a pupil of Socrates, was one of the earliest, most influential philosophers. His reputation comes from his idealism of believing in the existence of universals. His theory of forms proposes that universals do not physically exist, like objects, but as heavenly forms. In the dialogue of the Republic, the character of Socrates describes the Form of the Good. His theory on justice in the soul relates to the idea of happiness relevant to the question of the meaning of life. In Platonism, the meaning of life is in attaining the highest form of knowledge, which is the Idea (Form) of the Good, from which all good and just things derive utility and value. Aristotelianism Main article: Aristotelian ethics Aristotle, an apprentice of Plato, was another early and influential philosopher, who argued that ethical knowledge is not certain knowledge (such as metaphysics and epistemology), but is general knowledge. Because it is not a theoretical discipline, a person had to study and practice in order to become \"good\"; thus if the person were to become virtuous, he could not simply study what virtue is, he had to be virtuous, via virtuous activities. To do this, Aristotle established what is virtuous: .mw - parser - output .templatequote overflow:hidden;margin:1 em 0;padding:0 32 px .mw - parser - output .templatequotecite line - height:1.5 em;text - align:left;margin - top:0  media(min - width:500 px) .mw - parser - output .templatequotecite padding - left:1.6 em  Every skill and every inquiry, and similarly, every action and choice of action, is thought to have some good as its object. This is why the good has rightly been defined as the object of all endeavor  ... Everything is done with a goal, and that goal is \"good\". Nicomachean Ethics 1.1 Yet, if action A is done towards achieving goal B, then goal B also would have a goal, goal C, and goal C also would have a goal, and so would continue this pattern, until something stopped its infinite regression. Aristotle's solution is the Highest Good, which is desirable for its own sake. It is its own goal. The Highest Good is not desirable for the sake of achieving some other good, and all other \"goods\" desirable for its sake. This involves achieving eudaemonia, usually translated as \"happiness\", \"well - being\", \"flourishing\", and \"excellence\". What is the highest good in all matters of action? To the name, there is an almost complete agreement; for uneducated and educated alike call it happiness, and make happiness identical with the good life and successful living. They disagree, however, about the meaning of happiness. Nicomachean Ethics 1.4 Cynicism Main article: Cynicism (philosophy) Antisthenes, a pupil of Socrates, first outlined the themes of Cynicism, stating that the purpose of life is living a life of Virtue which agrees with Nature. Happiness depends upon being self - sufficient and master of one's mental attitude; suffering is the consequence of false judgments of value, which cause negative emotions and a concomitant vicious character. The Cynical life rejects conventional desires for wealth, power, health, and fame, by being free of the possessions acquired in pursuing the conventional. 74  75  As reasoning creatures, people could achieve happiness via rigorous training, by living in a way natural to human beings. The world equally belongs to everyone, so suffering is caused by false judgments of what is valuable and what is worthless per the customs and conventions of society. Cyrenaicism Main article: Cyrenaics Aristippus of Cyrene, a pupil of Socrates, founded an early Socratic school that emphasized only one side of Socrates's teachings that happiness is one of the ends of moral action and that pleasure is the supreme good; thus a hedonistic world view, wherein bodily gratification is more intense than mental pleasure. Cyrenaics prefer immediate gratification to the long - term gain of delayed gratification; denial is unpleasant unhappiness. 76  77  Epicureanism Main article: Epicureanism Epicurus by Agostino Scilla, circa 1670 1680. The philosopher holds a text that reads \"whatever you do, do wisely and think of consequences\" Epicurus, a pupil of the Platonist Pamphilus of Samos, taught that the greatest good is in seeking modest pleasures, to attain tranquility and freedom from fear (ataraxia) via knowledge, friendship, and virtuous, temperate living; bodily pain (aponia) is absent through one's knowledge of the workings of the world and of the limits of one's desires. Combined, freedom from pain and freedom from fear are happiness in its highest form. Epicurus' lauded enjoyment of simple pleasures is quasi - ascetic \"abstention\" from sex and the appetites: \"When we say ... that pleasure is the end and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do, by some, through ignorance, prejudice or willful misrepresentation. By pleasure, we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the soul. It is not by an unbroken succession of drinking bouts and of revelry, not by sexual lust, nor the enjoyment of fish, and other delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest tumults take possession of the soul.\" 78  The Epicurean meaning of life rejects immortality and mysticism; there is a soul, but it is as mortal as the body. There is no afterlife, yet, one need not fear death, because \"Death is nothing to us; for that which is dissolved, is without sensation, and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us.\" 79  Stoicism Main article: Stoicism Zeno of Citium, a pupil of Crates of Thebes, established the school which teaches that living according to reason and virtue is to be in harmony with the universe's divine order, entailed by one's recognition of the universal logos, or reason, an essential value of all people. The meaning of life is \"freedom from suffering\" through apatheia (Gr:        ), that is, being objective and having \"clear judgement\", not indifference. Stoicism's prime directives are virtue, reason, and natural law, abided to develop personal self - control and mental fortitude as means of overcoming destructive emotions. The Stoic does not seek to extinguish emotions, only to avoid emotional troubles, by developing clear judgment and inner calm through diligently practiced logic, reflection, and concentration. The Stoic ethical foundation is that \"good lies in the state of the soul\", itself, exemplified in wisdom and self - control, thus improving one's spiritual well - being: \"Virtue consists in a will which is in agreement with Nature.\" 79  The principle applies to one's personal relations thus: \"to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy\". 79  Enlightenment philosophy Further information: Enlightenment philosophy The Enlightenment and the colonial era both changed the nature of European philosophy and exported it worldwide. Devotion and subservience to God were largely replaced by notions of inalienable natural rights and the potentialities of reason, and universal ideals of love and compassion gave way to civic notions of freedom, equality, and citizenship. The meaning of life changed as well, focusing less on humankind's relationship to God and more on the relationship between individuals and their society. This era is filled with theories that equate meaningful existence with the social order. Kantianism Immanuel Kant Kantianism is a philosophy based on the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical works of Immanuel Kant. Kant is known for his deontological theory where there is a single moral obligation, the \"Categorical Imperative\", derived from the concept of duty. Kantians believe all actions are performed in accordance with some underlying maxim or principle, and for actions to be ethical, they must adhere to the categorical imperative. Simply put, the test is that one must universalize the maxim (imagine that all people acted in this way) and then see if it would still be possible to perform the maxim in the world without contradiction. In Groundwork, Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a universal action, no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty). Kant also denied that the consequences of an act in any way contribute to the moral worth of that act, his reasoning being that the physical world is outside one's full control and thus one cannot be held accountable for the events that occur in it. 19 th - century philosophy Further information: 19 th - century philosophyThe first English use of the expression \"meaning of life\" appeared in Thomas Carlyle's Sartor Resartus (1833 August 1834): \"Our Life is compassed round with Necessity; yet is the meaning of Life itself no other than Freedom, than Voluntary Force: thus have we a warfare; in the beginning, especially, a hard - fought battle.\" 80  Utilitarianism Jeremy Bentham The origins of utilitarianism can be traced back as far as Epicurus, but, as a school of thought, it is credited to Jeremy Bentham, 81  who found that \"nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure\"; then, from that moral insight, he derived the Rule of Utility: \"that the good is whatever brings the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people\". He defined the meaning of life as the \"greatest happiness principle\". Jeremy Bentham's foremost proponent was James Mill, a significant philosopher in his day, and father of John Stuart Mill. The younger Mill was educated per Bentham's principles, including transcribing and summarizing much of his father's work. 82  Nihilism Nihilism suggests that life is without objective meaning. Friedrich Nietzsche characterized nihilism as emptying the world, and especially human existence, of meaning, purpose, comprehensible truth, and essential value; succinctly, nihilism is the process of \"the devaluing of the highest values\". 83  Seeing the nihilist as a natural result of the idea that God is dead, and insisting it was something to overcome, his questioning of the nihilist's life - negating values returned meaning to the Earth. 84  To Martin Heidegger, nihilism is the movement whereby \"being\" is forgotten, and is transformed into value, in other words, the reduction of being to exchange value. 83  Heidegger, in accordance with Nietzsche, saw in the so - called \"death of God\" a potential source for nihilism: If God, as the supra - sensory ground and goal, of all reality, is dead; if the supra - sensory world of the Ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory, and above it, its vitalizing and up - building power, then nothing more remains to which Man can cling, and by which he can orient himself. 85  The French philosopher Albert Camus asserts that the absurdity of the human condition is that people search for external values and meaning in a world which has none and is indifferent to them. Camus writes of value - nihilists such as Meursault, 86  but also of values in a nihilistic world, that people can instead strive to be \"heroic nihilists\", living with dignity in the face of absurdity, living with \"secular saintliness\", fraternal solidarity, and rebelling against and transcending the world's indifference. 87  20 th - century philosophy Further information: 20 th - century philosophy Philosopher Bertrand Russell said: \"The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge.\" The current era has seen radical changes in both formal and popular conceptions of human nature. The knowledge disclosed by modern science has effectively rewritten the relationship of humankind to the natural world. Advances in medicine and technology have freed humans from significant limitations and ailments of previous eras; 88  and philosophy particularly following the linguistic turn has altered how the relationships people have with themselves and each other are conceived. Questions about the meaning of life have also seen radical changes, from attempts to reevaluate human existence in biological and scientific terms (as in pragmatism and logical positivism) to efforts to meta - theorize about meaning - making as a personal, individual - driven activity (existentialism, secular humanism). Pragmatism Pragmatism originated in the late - 19 th - century US, concerning itself (mostly) with truth, and positing that \"only in struggling with the environment\" do data, and derived theories, have meaning, and that consequences, like utility and practicality, are also components of truth. Moreover, pragmatism posits that anything useful and practical is not always true, arguing that what most contributes to the most human good in the long course is true. In practice, theoretical claims must be practically verifiable, i.e. one should be able to predict and test claims, and, that, ultimately, the needs of humankind should guide human intellectual inquiry. Pragmatic philosophers suggest that the practical, useful understanding of life is more important than searching for an impractical abstract truth about life. William James argued that truth could be made, but not sought. 89  90  To a pragmatist, the meaning of life is discoverable only via experience. Theism Main article: Philosophical theism Theists believe God created the universe and that God had a purpose in doing so. Theists also hold the view that humans find their meaning and purpose for life in God's purpose in creating. Some theists further hold that if there were no God to give life ultimate meaning, value, and purpose, then life would be absurd. 91  Existentialism Main article: Meaning (existential) Edvard Munch, Friedrich Nietzsche, 1906 According to existentialism, each person creates the essence (meaning) of their life; life is not determined by a supernatural god or an earthly authority, one is free. As such, one's ethical prime directives are action, freedom, and decision, thus, existentialism opposes rationalism and positivism. In seeking meaning to life, the existentialist looks to where people find meaning in life, in course of which using only reason as a source of meaning is insufficient; this gives rise to the emotions of anxiety and dread, felt in considering one's free will, and the concomitant awareness of death. According to Jean - Paul Sartre, existence precedes essence; the (essence) of one's life arises only after one comes to existence. S ren Kierkegaard spoke about a \"leap\", arguing that life is full of absurdity, and one must make his and her own values in an indifferent world. One can live meaningfully (free of despair and anxiety) in an unconditional commitment to something finite and devotes that meaningful life to the commitment, despite the vulnerability inherent to doing so. 92  Arthur Schopenhauer answered: \"What is the meaning of life?\" by stating that one's life reflects one's will, and that the will (life) is an aimless, irrational, and painful drive. Salvation, deliverance, and escape from suffering are in aesthetic contemplation, sympathy for others, and asceticism. 93  94  For Friedrich Nietzsche, life is worth living only if there are goals inspiring one to live. Accordingly, he saw nihilism (\"all that happens is meaningless\") as without goals. He stated that asceticism denies one's living in the world; stated that values are not objective facts, that are rationally necessary, universally binding commitments: our evaluations are interpretations, and not reflections of the world, as it is, in itself, and, therefore, all ideations take place from a particular perspective. 84  Absurdism Main article: Absurdism .mw - parser - output .quotebox background - color: F 9 F 9 F 9;border:1 px solid  aaa;box - sizing:border - box;padding:10 px;font - size:88 ;max - width:100  .mw - parser - output .quotebox.floatleft margin:.5 em 1.4 em .8 em 0 .mw - parser - output .quotebox.floatright margin:.5 em 0 .8 em 1.4 em .mw - parser - output .quotebox.centered overflow:hidden;position:relative;margin:.5 em auto .8 em auto .mw - parser - output .quotebox.floatleft span,.mw - parser - output .quotebox.floatright span font - style:inherit .mw - parser - output .quotebox blockquote margin:0;padding:0;border - left:0;font - family:inherit;font - size:inherit .mw - parser - output .quotebox - title text - align:center;font - size:110 ;font - weight:bold .mw - parser - output .quotebox - quote :first - child margin - top:0 .mw - parser - output .quotebox - quote:last - child :last - child margin - bottom:0 .mw - parser - output .quotebox - quote.quoted:before font - family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font - weight:bold;font - size:large;color:gray;content:\"   \";vertical - align: - 45 ;line - height:0 .mw - parser - output .quotebox - quote.quoted:after font - family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font - weight:bold;font - size:large;color:gray;content:\"   \";line - height:0 .mw - parser - output .quotebox .left - aligned text - align:left .mw - parser - output .quotebox .right - aligned text - align:right .mw - parser - output .quotebox .center - aligned text - align:center .mw - parser - output .quotebox .quote - title,.mw - parser - output .quotebox .quotebox - quote display:block .mw - parser - output .quotebox cite display:block;font - style:normal  media screen and (max - width:640 px) .mw - parser - output .quotebox width:100 !important;margin:0 0 .8 em!important;float:none!important   \"... in spite of or in defiance of the whole of existence he wills to be himself with it, to take it along, almost defying his torment.

And as for seeking help from any other no, that he will not do for all the world; rather than seek the help he would prefer to be himself with all the tortures of hell if so it must be.\" S ren Kierkegaard, The Sickness Unto Death 95  In absurdist philosophy, the Absurd arises out of the fundamental disharmony between the individual's search for meaning and the apparent meaninglessness of the universe. As beings looking for meaning in a meaningless world, humans have three ways of resolving the dilemma. Kierkegaard and Camus describe the solutions in their works, The Sickness Unto Death (1849) and The Myth of Sisyphus (1942): Suicide (or, \"escaping existence\"): a solution in which a person simply ends one's own life. Both Kierkegaard and Camus dismiss the viability of this option. Religious belief in a transcendent realm or being: a solution in which one believes in the existence of a reality that is beyond the Absurd, and, as such, has meaning. Kierkegaard stated that a belief in anything beyond the Absurd requires a non - rational but perhaps necessary religious acceptance in such an intangible and empirically unprovable thing (now commonly referred to as a \"leap of faith\"). However, Camus regarded this solution as \"philosophical suicide\". Acceptance of the Absurd: a solution in which one accepts and even embraces the Absurd and continues to live in spite of it. Camus endorsed this solution (notably in his 1947 allegorical novel The Plague or La Peste), while Kierkegaard regarded this solution as \"demoniac madness\": \"He rages most of all at the thought that eternity might get it into its head to take his misery from him!\" 96  Secular humanism Further information: Secular humanism The \"Happy Human\" symbol representing secular humanism Per secular humanism, the human species came to be by reproducing successive generations in a progression of unguided evolution as an integral expression of nature, which is self - existing. 97  98  Human knowledge comes from human observation, experimentation, and rational analysis (the scientific method), and not from supernatural sources; the nature of the universe is what people discern it to be. 97  Likewise, \"values and realities\" are determined \"by means of intelligent inquiry\" 97  and \"are derived from human need and interest as tested by experience\", that is, by critical intelligence. 99  100  \"As far as we know, the total personality is  a function  of the biological organism transacting in a social and cultural context.\" 98  People determine human purpose without supernatural influence; it is the human personality (general sense) that is the purpose of a human being's life which humanism seeks to develop and fulfill: 97  \"Humanism affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity\". 99  Humanism aims to promote enlightened self - interest and the common good for all people. It is based on the premises that the happiness of the individual person is inextricably linked to the well - being of all humanity, in part because humans are social animals who find meaning in personal relations and because cultural progress benefits everybody living in the culture. 98  99  The philosophical subgenres posthumanism and transhumanism (sometimes used synonymously) are extensions of humanistic values. One should seek the advancement of humanity and of all life to the greatest degree feasible and seek to reconcile Renaissance humanism with the 21 st century's technoscientific culture. In this light, every living creature has the right to determine its personal and social \"meaning of life\". 101  From a humanism - psychotherapeutic point of view, the question of the meaning of life could be reinterpreted as \"What is the meaning of my life?\" 102  This approach emphasizes that the question is personal and avoids focusing on cosmic or religious questions about overarching purpose. There are many therapeutic responses to this question. For example, Viktor Frankl argues for \"Dereflection\", which translates largely as to cease endlessly reflecting on the self; instead, engage in life. On the whole, the therapeutic response is that the question itself what is the meaning of life? evaporates when one is fully engaged in life. (The question then morphs into more specific worries such as \"What delusions am I under?\"; \"What is blocking my ability to enjoy things?\"; \"Why do I neglect loved - ones?\".) 103  Logical positivism Logical positivists ask: \"What is the meaning of life?\", \"What is the meaning in asking?\" 104  105  and \"If there are no objective values, then, is life meaningless?\" 106  Ludwig Wittgenstein and the logical positivists said: citation needed  \"Expressed in language, the question is meaningless\"; because, in life the statement the \"meaning of x\", usually denotes the consequences of x, or the significance of x, or what is notable about x, etc., thus, when the meaning of life concept equals \"x\", in the statement the \"meaning of x\", the statement becomes recursive, and, therefore, nonsensical, or it might refer to the fact that biological life is essential to having a meaning in life. The things (people, events) in the life of a person can have meaning (importance) as parts of a whole, but a discrete meaning of (the) life, itself, aside from those things, cannot be discerned. A person's life has meaning (for themselves, others) as the life events resulting from their achievements, legacy, family, etc., but, to say that life, itself, has meaning, is a misuse of language, since any note of significance, or of consequence, is relevant only in life (to the living), so rendering the statement erroneous. Bertrand Russell wrote that although he found that his distaste for torture was not like his distaste for broccoli, he found no satisfactory, empirical method of proving this: 79  When we try to be definite, as to what we mean when we say that this or that is \"the Good,\" we find ourselves involved in very great difficulties. Bentham's creed, that pleasure is the Good, roused furious opposition, and was said to be a pig's philosophy. Neither he nor his opponents could advance any argument. In a scientific question, evidence can be adduced on both sides, and, in the end, one side is seen to have the better case or, if this does not happen, the question is left undecided. But in a question, as to whether this, or that, is the ultimate Good, there is no evidence, either way; each disputant can only appeal to his own emotions, and employ such rhetorical devices as shall arouse similar emotions in others ... Questions as to \"values\" that is to say, as to what is good or bad on its own account, independently of its effects lie outside the domain of science, as the defenders of religion emphatically assert. I think that, in this, they are right, but, I draw the further conclusion, which they do not draw, that questions as to \"values\" lie wholly outside the domain of knowledge. That is to say, when we assert that this, or that, has \"value\", we are giving expression to our own emotions, not to a fact, which would still be true if our personal feelings were different. 107  Postmodernism Further information: Postmodernism Postmodernist thought broadly speaking sees human nature as constructed by language, or by structures and institutions of human society. Unlike other forms of philosophy, postmodernism rarely seeks out a priori or innate meanings in human existence, but instead focuses on analyzing or critiquing given meanings in order to rationalize or reconstruct them. Anything resembling a \"meaning of life\", in postmodernist terms, can only be understood within a social and linguistic framework and must be pursued as an escape from the power structures that are already embedded in all forms of speech and interaction. As a rule, postmodernists see awareness of the constraints of language as necessary to escaping those constraints, but different theorists take different views on the nature of this process: from a radical reconstruction of meaning by individuals (as in deconstructionism) to theories in which individuals are primarily extensions of language and society, without real autonomy (as in poststructuralism). Naturalistic pantheism According to naturalistic pantheism, the meaning of life is to care for and look after nature and the environment. Embodied cognition Embodied cognition uses the neurological basis of emotion, speech, and cognition to understand the nature of thought. Cognitive neuropsychology has identified brain areas necessary for these abilities, and genetic studies show that the gene FOXP 2 affects neuroplasticity which underlies language fluency. George Lakoff, a professor of cognitive linguistics and philosophy, advances the view that metaphors are the usual basis of meaning, not the logic of verbal symbol manipulation. 108  Computers use logic programming to effectively query databases but humans rely on a trained biological neural network. Postmodern philosophies that use the indeterminacy of symbolic language to deny definite meaning ignore those who feel they know what they mean and feel that their interlocutors know what they mean. citation needed  Choosing the correct metaphor results in enough common understanding to pursue questions such as the meaning of life. 109  Improved knowledge of brain function should result in better treatments producing healthier brains. When combined with more effective training, a sound personal assessment as to the meaning of one's life should be straightforward. citation needed  East Asian philosophical perspectives Further information: Chinese philosophy, Japanese philosophy, and Ikigai Mohism Further information: Mohism The Mohist philosophers believed that the purpose of life was universal, impartial love. Mohism promoted a philosophy of impartial caring a person should care equally for all other individuals, regardless of their actual relationship with him or her. 110  The expression of this indiscriminate caring is what makes a man a righteous being in Mohist thought. This advocacy of impartiality was a target of attack by the other Chinese philosophical schools, most notably the Confucians who believed that while love should be unconditional, it should not be indiscriminate. For example, children should hold a greater love for their parents than for random strangers. Confucianism Further information: Confucianism Confucianism recognizes human nature in accordance with the need for discipline and education. Because humankind is driven by both positive and negative influences, Confucianists see a goal in achieving virtue through strong relationships and reasoning as well as minimizing the negative. This emphasis on normal living is seen in the Confucianist scholar Tu Wei - Ming's quote, \"We can realize the ultimate meaning of life in ordinary human existence.\" 111  Legalism Further information: Legalism (Chinese philosophy) The Legalists believed that finding the purpose of life was a meaningless effort. To the Legalists, only practical knowledge was valuable, especially as it related to the function and performance of the state. Religious perspectives The religious perspectives on the meaning of life are those ideologies that explain life in terms of an implicit purpose not defined by humans. According to the Charter for Compassion, signed by many of the world's leading religious and secular organizations, the core of religion is the golden rule of 'treat others as you would have them treat you'. The Charter's founder, Karen Armstrong, quotes the ancient Rabbi Hillel who suggested that 'the rest is commentary'. This is not to reduce the commentary's importance, and Armstrong considers that its study, interpretation, and ritual are the means by which religious people internalize and live the golden rule. Abrahamic religions Symbols of the three main Abrahamic religions   Judaism, Christianity, and Islam Further information: Abrahamic religion Judaism In the Judaic worldview, the meaning of life is to elevate the physical world ('Olam HaZeh') and prepare it for the world to come ('Olam HaBa'), the messianic era. This is called Tikkun Olam (\"Fixing the World\"). Olam HaBa can also mean the spiritual afterlife, and there is debate concerning the eschatological order. However, Judaism is not focused on personal salvation, but on communal (between man and man) and individual (between man and God) spiritualised actions in this world. Judaism's most important feature is the worship of a single, incomprehensible, transcendent, one, indivisible, absolute Being, who created and governs the universe. Closeness with the God of Israel is through a study of His Torah, and adherence to its mitzvot (divine laws). In traditional Judaism, God established a special covenant with a people, the people of Israel, at Mount Sinai, giving the Jewish commandments. Torah comprises the written Pentateuch and the transcribed oral tradition, further developed through the generations. The Jewish people are intended as \"a kingdom of priests and a holy nation\" 112  and a \"light to the Nations\", influencing the other peoples to keep their own religio - ethical Seven Laws of Noah. The messianic era is seen as the perfection of this dual path to God. Jewish observances involve ethical and ritual, affirmative, and prohibitive injunctions. Modern Jewish denominations differ over the nature, relevance, and emphases of mitzvot. Jewish philosophy emphasises that God is not affected or benefited, but the individual and society benefit by drawing close to God. The rationalist Maimonides sees the ethical and ritual divine commandments as a necessary, but insufficient preparation for philosophical understanding of God, with its love and awe. 113  Among fundamental values in the Torah are pursuit of justice, compassion, peace, kindness, hard work, prosperity, humility, and education. 114  115  The world to come, 116  prepared in the present, elevates man to an everlasting connection with God. 117  Simeon the Righteous says, \"The world stands on three things: on Torah, on worship, and on acts of loving kindness.\" The prayer book relates, \"Blessed is our God who created us for his honor ... and planted within us everlasting life.\" Of this context, the Talmud states, \"Everything that God does is for the good.\" including suffering. The Jewish mystical Kabbalah gives complementary esoteric meanings of life. As well as Judaism providing an immanent relationship with God (personal theism), in Kabbalah, the spiritual and physical creation is a paradoxical manifestation of the immanent aspects of God's Being (panentheism), related to the Shekhinah (Divine feminine). Jewish observance unites the sephirot (Divine attributes) on high, restoring harmony to creation. In Lurianic Kabbalah, the meaning of life is the messianic rectification of the shattered sparks of God's persona, exiled in physical existence (the Kelipot shells), through the actions of Jewish observance. 118  Through this, in Hasidic Judaism the ultimate essential \"desire\" of God is the revelation of the Omnipresent Divine essence through materiality, achieved by a man from within his limited physical realm when the body will give life to the soul. 119  Christianity Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro is symbolic of Christianity, 120  illustrating the concept of seeking redemption through Jesus Christ. Christianity has its roots in Judaism, and shares much of the latter faith's ontology. Its central beliefs derive from the teachings of Jesus Christ as presented in the New Testament. Life's purpose in Christianity is to seek divine salvation through the grace of God and intercession of Christ. 121  The New Testament speaks of God wanting to have a relationship with humans both in this life and the life to come, which can happen only if one's sins are forgiven. 122  In the Christian view, humankind was made in the Image of God and perfect, but the Fall of Man caused the progeny of the First Parents to inherit Original Sin and its consequences. Christ's passion, death and resurrection provide the means for transcending that impure state (Romans 6:23). That this restoration from sin is possible is called the gospel. The Apostle Paul explains the meaning of life in his speech on the Areopagus in Athens: \"And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings, so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us.\" 123  Denominations The specific process of appropriating salvation through Christ and maintaining a relationship with God varies between different denominations of Christians, but all rely on faith in Christ and the gospel as the fundamental starting point. Salvation through faith in God is found in Ephesians 2:8 9 8  \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; 9  not as a result of works, that no one should boast.\" (NASB; 1973). The gospel maintains that through this belief, the barrier that sin has created between man and God is destroyed, thereby allowing believers to be regenerated by God and to instill in them a new heart after God's own will with the ability to live righteously before him. This is what the term saved almost always refer to. In Reformed theology, it is believed the purpose of life is to glorify God. In the Westminster Shorter Catechism, an important creed for Reformed Christians, 124  the first question is: \"What is the chief end of Man?\" (that is, \"What is Man's main purpose?\"). The answer is: \"Man's chief end is to glorify God, and enjoy him forever\". God requires one to obey the revealed moral law, saying: \"Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbour as yourself\". 125  The Baltimore Catechism answers the question \"Why did God make you?\" by saying \"God made me to know Him, to love Him, and to serve Him in this world, and to be happy with Him forever in heaven.\" 126  Catholicism's meaning of life is explained in Catechism of the Catholic Church paragraph 294. The Universe exists for the manifestation and communication of God's glory, while mankind exists for the beatific vision. 127  Catechism of the Catholic Church 601 explains the meaning of Jesus' life: to fulfill the Scripture, in particular the plan of salvation. 128  Mormonism teaches that the purpose of life on Earth is to gain knowledge and experience and to have joy. 129  Mormons believe that humans are literally the spirit children of God the Father, and thus have the potential to progress to become like Him. Mormons teach that God provided his children the choice to come to Earth, which is considered a crucial stage in their development wherein a mortal body, coupled with the freedom to choose, makes for an environment to learn and grow. 129  The Fall of Adam is not viewed as an unfortunate or unplanned cancellation of God's original plan for a paradise; rather, the opposition found in mortality is an essential element of God's plan because the process of enduring and overcoming challenges, difficulties, and temptations provides opportunities to gain wisdom and strength, thereby learning to appreciate and choose good and reject evil. 130  131  Because God is just, he allows those who were not taught the gospel during mortality to receive it after death in the spirit world, 132  so that all of his children have the opportunity to return to live with God, and reach their full potential. A recent alternative Christian theological discourse interprets Jesus as revealing that the purpose of life is to elevate our compassionate response to human suffering; 133  nonetheless, the conventional Christian position is that people are justified by belief in the propitiatory sacrifice of Jesus' death on the cross. Islam Supplicating Pilgrim at Masjid Al Haram. Mecca In Islam, humanity's ultimate purpose is to worship their creator, Allah (English: The God), through his signs, and be grateful to him through sincere love and devotion. This is practically shown by following the divine guidelines revealed in the Qur'an and the tradition of the Prophet (with the exception of Quranists). Earthly life is a test, determining one's position of closeness to Allah in the hereafter. A person will either be close to him and his love in Jannah (Paradise) or far away in Jahannam (Hell). For Allah's satisfaction, via the Qur'an, all Muslims must believe in God, his revelations, his angels, his messengers, and in the \"Day of Judgment\". 134  The Qur'an describes the purpose of creation as follows: \"Blessed be he in whose hand is the kingdom, he is powerful over all things, who created death and life that he might examine which of you is best in deeds, and he is the almighty, the forgiving.\" (Qur'an 67:1 2) and \"And I (All h) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should be obedient (to Allah).\" (Qur'an 51:56). Obedience testifies to the oneness of God in his lordship, his names, and his attributes. Terrenal life is a test; how one acts (behaves) determines whether one's soul goes to Jannat (Heaven) or to Jahannam (Hell). 135  citation needed  However, on the day of Judgement the final decision is of Allah alone. 136  The Five Pillars of Islam are duties incumbent to every Muslim; they are: Shahadah (profession of faith); Salat (ritual prayer); Zakat (charity); Sawm (fasting during Ramadan), and Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). 137  They derive from the Hadith works, notably of Sahih Al - Bukhari and Sahih Muslim. The five pillars are not mentioned directly in the Quran. Beliefs differ among the Kalam. The Sunni and the Ahmadiyya concept of pre - destination is divine decree; 138  the Shi'a concept of pre - destination is divine justice; in the esoteric view of the Sufis, the universe exists only for God's pleasure; Creation is a grand game, wherein Allah is the greatest prize. The Sufi view of the meaning of life stems from the hadith qudsi that states \"I (God) was a Hidden Treasure and loved to be known. Therefore I created the Creation that I might be known.\" One possible interpretation of this view is that the meaning of life for an individual is to know the nature of God, and the purpose of all of creation is to reveal that nature and to prove its value as the ultimate treasure, that is God. However, this hadith is stated in various forms and interpreted in various ways by people, such, as 'Abdu'l - Bah  of the Bah    Faith, 139  and in Ibn'Arab 's Fu    al - ikam. 140  According to Shaykh Ibrahim Niass, worship of God is closely linked to ma'rifa, 141  therefore the perfection of the aspirant's knowledge of God is conditional upon his attainment of ma'rifa. Bah    Faith The Bah    Faith emphasizes the unity of humanity. 142  To Bah   s, the purpose of life is focused on spiritual growth and service to humanity. Human beings are viewed as intrinsically spiritual beings. People's lives in this material world provide extended opportunities to grow, to develop divine qualities and virtues, and the prophets were sent by God to facilitate this. 143  144  South Asian religions Further information: Indian religions and Indian philosophy Hindu philosophies Further information: Hinduism, Hindu philosophy, and Dharma A golden Aum written in Devanagari. The Aum is sacred in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist religions. Hinduism is a religious category including many beliefs and traditions. Since Hinduism was the way of expressing meaningful living for a long time before there was a need for naming it as a separate religion, Hindu doctrines are supplementary and complementary in nature, generally non - exclusive, suggestive, and tolerant in content. 145  Most believe that the  tman (spirit, soul) the person's true self is eternal. 146  In part, this stems from Hindu beliefs that spiritual development occurs across many lifetimes, and goals should match the state of development of the individual. There are four possible aims to human life, known as the purusharthas (ordered from least to greatest): (i) K ma (wish, desire, love and sensual pleasure), (ii) Artha (wealth, prosperity, glory), (iii) Dharma (righteousness, duty, morality, virtue, ethics), encompassing notions such as ahimsa (non - violence) and satya (truth) and (iv) Moksha (liberation, i.e. liberation from Sa s ra, the cycle of reincarnation). 147  148  149  In all schools of Hinduism, the meaning of life is tied up in the concepts of karma (causal action), sansara (the cycle of birth and rebirth), and moksha (liberation). Existence is conceived as the progression of the  tman (similar to the western concept of a soul) across numerous lifetimes, and its ultimate progression towards liberation from karma. Particular goals for life are generally subsumed under broader yogas (practices) or dharma (correct living) which are intended to create more favorable reincarnations, though they are generally positive acts in this life as well. Traditional schools of Hinduism often worship Devas which are manifestations of Ishvara (a personal or chosen God); these Devas are taken as ideal forms to be identified with, as a form of spiritual improvement. In short, the goal is to realize the fundamental truth about oneself. This thought is conveyed in the Mah v kyas (\"Tat Tvam Asi\" (thou art that), \"Aham Brahm smi\", \"Praj  nam Brahma\" and \"Ayam  tm  Brahma\" (This  tman is Brahman)). Advaita and Dvaita Hinduism Further information: Advaita Vedanta and Dvaita Vedanta Later schools reinterpreted the vedas to focus on Brahman, \"The One Without a Second\", 150  as a central God - like figure. In monist Advaita Vedanta,  tman is ultimately indistinguishable from Brahman, and the goal of life is to know or realize that one's  tman (soul) is identical to Brahman. 151  To the Upanishads, whoever becomes fully aware of the  tman, as one's core of self, realizes identity with Brahman, and, thereby, achieves Moksha (liberation, freedom). 146  152  153  Dvaita Vedanta and other bhakti schools have a dualist interpretation. Brahman is seen as a supreme being with a personality and manifest qualities. The  tman depends upon Brahman for its existence; the meaning of life is achieving Moksha through the love of God and upon His grace. 152  Vaishnavism Vaishnavism is a branch of Hinduism in which the principal belief is the identification of Vishnu or Narayana as the one supreme God. This belief contrasts with the Krishna - centered traditions, such as Vallabha, Nimbaraka and Gaudiya, in which Krishna is considered to be the One and only Supreme God and the source of all avataras. 154  Vaishnava theology includes the central beliefs of Hinduism such as monotheism, reincarnation, samsara, karma, and the various Yoga systems, but with a particular emphasis on devotion (bhakti) to Vishnu through the process of Bhakti yoga, often including singing Vishnu's name's (bhajan), meditating upon his form (dharana) and performing deity worship (puja). The practices of deity worship are primarily based on texts such as Pa caratra and various Samhitas. 155  One popular school of thought, Gaudiya Vaishnavism, teaches the concept of Achintya Bheda Abheda. In this, Krishna is worshipped as the single true God, and all living entities are eternal parts and the Supreme Personality of the Godhead Krishna. Thus the constitutional position of a living entity is to serve the Lord with love and devotion. The purpose of human life especially is to think beyond the animalistic way of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending and engage the higher intelligence to revive the lost relationship with Krishna. Jainism Further information: Jainism and Jain philosophy Jainism is a religion originating in ancient India, its ethical system promotes self - discipline above all else. Through following the ascetic teachings of Jina, a human achieves enlightenment (perfect knowledge). Jainism divides the universe into living and non - living beings. Only when the living becomes attached to the non - living does suffering result. Therefore, happiness is the result of self - conquest and freedom from external objects. The meaning of life may then be said to be to use the physical body to achieve self - realization and bliss. 156  Jains believe that every human is responsible for his or her actions and all living beings have an eternal soul, jiva. Jains believe all souls are equal because they all possess the potential of being liberated and attaining Moksha. The Jain view of karma is that every action, every word, every thought has effect on the soul. Jainism includes strict adherence to ahimsa (or ahins ), a form of nonviolence that goes far beyond vegetarianism. Jains refuse food obtained with unnecessary cruelty. Many practice a lifestyle similar to veganism due to the violence of modern dairy farms, and others exclude root vegetables from their diets in order to preserve the lives of the plants from which they eat. 157  Buddhism Early Buddhism Statue of Gautama Buddha Buddhists practice embracing mindfulness, the ill - being (suffering) and well - being that is present in life. Buddhists practice seeing the causes of ill - being and well - being in life. For example, one of the causes of suffering is an unhealthy attachment to objects material or non - material. The Buddhist s tras and tantras do not speak about \"the meaning of life\" or \"the purpose of life\", but about the potential of human life to end suffering, for example through embracing (not suppressing or denying) cravings and conceptual attachments. Attaining and perfecting dispassion is a process of many levels that ultimately results in the state of Nirvana. Nirvana means freedom from both suffering and rebirth. 158  Theravada Buddhism is generally considered to be close to the early Buddhist practice. It promotes the concept of Vibhajjavada (Pali), literally \"Teaching of Analysis\", which says that insight must come from the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. However, the Theravadin tradition also emphasizes heeding the advice of the wise, considering such advice and evaluation of one's own experiences to be the two tests by which practices should be judged. The Theravadin goal is liberation (or freedom) from suffering, according to the Four Noble Truths. This is attained in the achievement of Nirvana, or Unbinding which also ends the repeated cycle of birth, old age, sickness, and death. The way to attain Nirvana is by following and practicing the Noble Eightfold Path. Mahayana Buddhism Further information: Mahayana Mahayana Buddhist schools de - emphasize the traditional view (still practiced in Theravada) of the release from individual Suffering (Duhkha) and attainment of Awakening (Nirvana). In Mahayana, the Buddha is seen as an eternal, immutable, inconceivable, omnipresent being. The fundamental principles of Mahayana doctrine are based on the possibility of universal liberation from suffering for all beings, and the existence of the transcendent Buddha - nature, which is the eternal Buddha essence present, but hidden and unrecognised, in all living beings. 159  Philosophical schools of Mahayana Buddhism, such as Chan Zen and the Vajrayana Tibetan and Shingon schools, explicitly teach that Bodhisattva should refrain from full liberation, allowing themselves to be reincarnated into the world until all beings achieve enlightenment. Devotional schools such as Pure Land Buddhism seek the aid of celestial buddhas individuals who have spent lifetimes accumulating positive karma, and use that accumulation to aid all. 160  Sikhism The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the ten Sikh Gurus, or enlightened leaders, as well as the holy scripture entitled the Gur  Granth S hib, which includes selected works of many philosophers from diverse socio - economic and religious backgrounds. The Sikh Gurus say that salvation can be obtained by following various spiritual paths, so Sikhs do not have a monopoly on salvation: \"The Lord dwells in every heart, and every heart has its own way to reach Him.\" 161  Sikhs believe that all people are equally important before God. 162  Sikhs balance their moral and spiritual values with the quest for knowledge, and they aim to promote a life of peace and equality but also of positive action. 163  A key distinctive feature of Sikhism is a non - anthropomorphic concept of God, to the extent that one can interpret God as the Universe itself (pantheism). Sikhism thus sees life as an opportunity to understand this God as well as to discover the divinity which lies in each individual. While a full understanding of God is beyond human beings, 164  Nanak described God as not wholly unknowable, and stressed that God must be seen from \"the inward eye\", or the \"heart\", of a human being: devotees must meditate to progress towards enlightenment and the ultimate destination of a Sikh is to lose the ego completely in the love of the lord and finally merge into the almighty creator. Nanak emphasized the revelation through meditation, as its rigorous application permits the existence of communication between God and human beings. 164  East Asian religions Taoism Taoist cosmogony emphasizes the need for all sentient beings and all men to return to the primordial or to rejoin with the Oneness of the Universe by way of self - cultivation and self - realization. All adherents should understand and be in tune with the ultimate truth. Taoists believe all things were originally from Taiji and Tao, and the meaning in life for the adherents is to realize the temporal nature of the existence. \"Only introspection can then help us to find our innermost reasons for living ... the simple answer is here within ourselves.\" 165  Shinto Shinto is the native religion of Japan. Shinto means \"the path of the kami\", but more specifically, it can be taken to mean \"the divine crossroad where the kami chooses his way\". The \"divine\" crossroad signifies that all the universe is divine spirit. This foundation of free will, choosing one's way, means that life is a creative process. Shinto wants life to live, not to die. Shinto sees death as pollution and regards life as the realm where the divine spirit seeks to purify itself by rightful self - development. Shinto wants individual human life to be prolonged forever on earth as a victory of the divine spirit in preserving its objective personality in its highest forms. The presence of evil in the world, as conceived by Shinto, does not stultify the divine nature by imposing on divinity responsibility for being able to relieve human suffering while refusing to do so. The sufferings of life are the sufferings of the divine spirit in search of progress in the objective world. 166  New religions There are many new religious movements in East Asia, and some with millions of followers: Chondogyo, Tenrikyo, Cao   i, and Seicho - No - Ie. New religions typically have unique explanations for the meaning of life. For example, in Tenrikyo, one is expected to live a Joyous Life by participating in practices that create happiness for oneself and others. Iranian religions Further information: Iranian philosophy Zoroastrianism Zoroastrians believe in a universe created by a transcendent God, Ahura Mazda, to whom all worship is ultimately directed. Ahura Mazda's creation is asha, truth and order, and it is in conflict with its antithesis, druj, falsehood and disorder. 167  Since humanity possesses free will, people must be responsible for their moral choices. By using free will, people must take an active role in the universal conflict, with good thoughts, good words and good deeds to ensure happiness and to keep chaos at bay.

In a word, each person is questioned by life; and they can only answer to life by answering for their own life; to life they can only respond by being responsible. 238  In popular culture The mystery of life and its true meaning is an often recurring subject in popular culture, featured in entertainment media and various forms of art. Monty Python's The Meaning of Life includes a character played by Michael Palin being handed an envelope containing \"the meaning of life\", which she opens and reads out to the audience: \"Well, it's nothing very special. Uh, try to be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try to live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations.\" 239  240  241  In Douglas Adams' book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is given the numeric solution \"42\", after seven and a half million years of calculation by a giant supercomputer called Deep Thought. When this answer is met with confusion and anger from its constructors, Deep Thought explains that \"I think the problem such as it was, was too broadly based. You never actually stated what the question was.\" 242  8  243  244  245  Deep Thought then constructs another computer the Earth to calculate what the Ultimate Question actually is. Later Ford and Arthur manage to extract the question as the Earth computer would have rendered it. That question turns out to be \"what do you get if you multiply six by nine\", 246  and it is realised that the program was ruined by the unexpected arrival of the Golgafrinchans on Earth, and so the actual Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, And Everything remains unknown. In Person of Interest season 5 episode 13, an artificial intelligence referred to as The Machine tells Harold Finch that the secret of life is \"Everyone dies alone. But if you mean something to someone, if you help someone, or love someone. If even a single person remembers you then maybe you never really die at all.\" This phrase is then repeated at the very end of the show to add emphasis to the finale. 247  Related concepts Existential crisis Charles Allan Gilbert's All is Vanity, an example of vanitas, depicts a young woman amidst her makeup and perfumes, preoccupied with her own beauty at the mirror of her vanity. But all is positioned in such a way as to make the image of a skull appear, expressing memento mori, that no matter how good she looks, it won't last, as death is inevitable. Existential crises are crises of meaning. They are triggered by the impression that life lacks meaning. 248  249  250  This impression can lead to an inner conflict because there is a strong desire to find some form of meaning in life. In the existentialist literature, the discrepancy between the individual's desire for meaning and the world's apparent lack thereof is termed the absurd. 251  252  253  It may be summarized by the question \"How does a being who needs meaning find meaning in a universe that has no meaning?\". 254  While this conflict may affect different people at least to some extent, it reaches a more severe level in the case of existential crises. This level leads to various negative experiences, such as stress, anxiety, despair, and depression. 254  249  250  In the more serious cases, these symptoms disturb the individual's normal functioning in everyday life. A positive side effect of these negative experiences is that they push the affected individual to address the underlying issue. This opens the opportunity of developing as a person and improving one's way of life. 254  255  Therapists often try to treat existential crises by helping their patients discover meaning in life. An important distinction in this regard is the difference between personal meaning and cosmic meaning. 254  256  In the cosmic sense, the term \"meaning of life\" refers to the purpose of the world as a whole or why we are here. One way to solve an existential crisis is to discover a satisfying answer to this question. This often takes the form of a religious explanation involving a divine entity that created the world for a certain purpose. 254  257  258  Another approach to solving existential crises is to seek meaning not on the cosmic but on the personal level. This usually takes a more secular form: the therapist helps the individual realize what matters to them or why their life is worth living. 254  256  259  In this regard, they may discover how their personal life can be meaningful, for example, by dedicating themselves to their family or their career. This approach may mitigate or solve an existential crisis even if the individual still lacks an answer to the bigger question of the deeper meaning behind everything. 254  250  257  Importance The question of the meaning of life is closely related to the question of what has importance or what matters. This is reflected in the fact that finding meaning in life is often associated with dedicating oneself to some kind of higher purpose, which is seen as having special importance. 260  261  Nonetheless, some theorists have argued that the two concepts are not identical. 260  262  This distinction is often motivated by the observation that seeking the meaning of life is usually regarded as an admirable goal associated with self - transcendence. Craving importance, on the other hand, seems to be a more egoistic or narcissistic aim in comparison. 260  Various theorists have argued that to be important means to have an impact on the world or to make a difference. Some only require that this causal impact is big enough. Others include as an additional element that the difference in question has to affect the value of the world. 263  262  264  This is often interpreted with reference to well - being: the degree of importance of a thing is given by the extent to which it affects the well - being of sentient entities. 265  262  266  However, the relation to a purpose is usually not required for importance. In this regard, some things may be important accidentally or unintentionally without being guided by a higher goal. For example, a person may by chance bump into something and thereby unwittingly trigger a butterfly effect of extreme proportions. In such a case, the person's life has acquired high importance due to the consequences it caused. Nonetheless, this does not imply that it has also acquired some form of deeper meaning or higher purpose. 260  Another difference is that seeking and realizing the meaning of life is usually seen by most theorists as a positive and worthwhile undertaking. Importance, however, can be either positive or negative depending on the type of value difference involved. 260  262  For example, Alexander Fleming was important in a positive sense since his discovery of penicillin helped many people cure their bacterial infections. 267  Adolf Hitler, on the other hand, was important in a negative sense since his policies caused widespread suffering to innumerous people. 263  See also .mw - parser - output .portalbox padding:0;margin:0.5 em 0;display:table;box - sizing:border - box;max - width:175 px;list - style:none .mw - parser - output .portalborder border:1 px solid var( -  - border - color - base, a 2 a 9 b 1);padding:0.1 em;background:var( -  - background - color - neutral - subtle, f 8 f 9 fa) .mw - parser - output .portalbox - entry display:table - row;font - size:85 ;line - height:110 ;height:1.9 em;font - style:italic;font - weight:bold .mw - parser - output .portalbox - image display:table - cell;padding:0.2 em;vertical - align:middle;text - align:center .mw - parser - output .portalbox - link display:table - cell;padding:0.2 em 0.2 em 0.2 em 0.3 em;vertical - align:middle  media(min - width:720 px) .mw - parser - output .portalleft margin:0.5 em 1 em 0.5 em 0 .mw - parser - output .portalright clear:right;float:right;margin:0.5 em 0 0.5 em 1 em   Philosophy portal Scientific explanations Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life   1995 book by Daniel Dennett The Death of God and the Meaning of Life   2014 book by Julian Young Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life   2005 book by Nick Lane Sex, Death and the Meaning of Life   2010 three - part television documentary Origin and nature of life and reality .mw - parser - output .div - col margin - top:0.3 em;column - width:30 em .mw - parser - output .div - col - small font - size:90  .mw - parser - output .div - col - rules column - rule:1 px solid  aaa .mw - parser - output .div - col dl,.mw - parser - output .div - col ol,.mw - parser - output .div - col ul margin - top:0 .mw - parser - output .div - col li,.mw - parser - output .div - col dd page - break - inside:avoid;break - inside:avoid - column  Abiogenesis   Life arising from non - living matter Awareness   Perception or knowledge of something Being   State of being realPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets Biosemiotics   Biology interpreted as a sign system Dao   Philosophical concept native to ChinaPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets Existence   State of being real Human condition   Ultimate concerns of human existence Logos   Concept in philosophy, religion, rhetoric, and psychology Metaphysical naturalism   Philosophical worldview rejecting anything supernatural Perception   Interpretation of sensory information Reality   Sum or aggregate of all that is real or existent Simulated reality   Concept of a false version of reality Theory of everything   Hypothetical physical concept Teleology   Thinking in terms of destiny or purpose Ultimate fate of the universe   Theories about the end of the universe Value of life Culture of life   Way of life highlighting life's sanctity;

    "ai_overview": "Different philosophical traditions approach the meaning of life from diverse perspectives. Here's a summary of some key viewpoints:\n* **Ancient Greek Philosophy:**\n* **Platonism:** The meaning of life is in attaining the highest form of knowledge, the Idea of the Good, from which all good and just things derive utility and value.\n* **Aristotelianism:** Achieving eudaimonia, often translated as happiness, well-being, flourishing, and excellence, is the highest good.\n* **Cynicism:** Living a life of virtue in agreement with nature is the purpose of life. Happiness depends on self-sufficiency and control over one's mental attitude.\n* **Cyrenaicism:** Pleasure is the supreme good.\n* **Epicureanism:** Seeking modest pleasures to attain tranquility and freedom from fear (ataraxia). Freedom from pain and fear is happiness in its highest form.\n* **Stoicism:** Living according to reason and virtue is to be in harmony with the universe's divine order. Meaning is \"freedom from suffering\" through objectivity and clear judgment.\n* **Enlightenment Philosophy:** Focuses on the relationship between individuals and their society, emphasizing natural rights and the potentialities of reason.\n* **Kantianism:** Adhering to the categorical imperative and acting in accordance with duty.\n* **19th-Century Philosophy:**\n* **Utilitarianism:** The meaning of life is the \"greatest happiness principle,\" aiming to bring the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people.\n* **Nihilism:** Life is without objective meaning, a concept that Friedrich Nietzsche explored, suggesting it should be overcome by creating new values.\n* **20th-Century Philosophy:**\n* **Pragmatism:** The practical and useful understanding of life is more important than searching for an impractical abstract truth.\n* **Theism:** Meaning and purpose are found in God's purpose in creating the universe and humanity.\n* **Existentialism:** Each person creates the essence of their life. Ethical directives are action, freedom, and decision.\n* **Absurdism:** Acceptance of the Absurd and continuing to live in spite of it.\n* **Secular Humanism:** Values and realities are derived from human need and interest as tested by experience.\n* **Logical Positivism:** The question \"What is the meaning of life?\" is meaningless because it is a misuse of language.\n* **East Asian Philosophical Perspectives:**\n* **Mohism:** The purpose of life is universal, impartial love.\n* **Confucianism:** Achieving virtue through strong relationships and reasoning while minimizing negative influences.\n* **Taoism: All sentient beings and all men should return to the primordial or to rejoin with the Oneness of the Universe by self-cultivation and self-realization.\n* **Religious Perspectives:**\n* **Judaism:** Elevating the physical world and preparing it for the messianic era through adherence to God's laws and ethical actions.\n* **Christianity:** Seeking divine salvation through faith in God and the intercession of Christ.\n* **Islam:** Worshipping Allah, following divine guidelines revealed in the Qur'an, and acting righteously to attain closeness to Allah in the afterlife.\n* **Hinduism:** Tied to karma, samsara (the cycle of birth and rebirth), and moksha (liberation).\n* **Jainism:** Achieving self-realization and bliss through self-conquest and freedom from external objects.\n* **Buddhism:** Ending suffering and achieving Nirvana through embracing mindfulness and seeing the causes of ill-being and well-being.\n* **Sikhism:** Understanding God and discovering the divinity within each individual.\n* **Zoroastrianism:** Actively participating in the universal conflict between good and evil with good thoughts, words, and deeds.",

Often these definitions will be nothing more than descriptions or rely on more controversial theoretical commitments. Like many basic concepts, it is difficult to non - controversially define life. Most people simply avoid the issue by ignoring marginal cases, accepting the vagueness of the boundary cases, or setting aside the whole issue as beyond their scope. Nonetheless, there are many people whose work seems to require a rigorous demarcation of life, especially in new scientific contexts, such as astrobiology, origins of life, or synthetic biology. As such, the nature of life continues to be a hotly debated topic. This article focuses on the subject matter of biology: life. The first half of this article will focus on attempts to characterize life by both philosophers and scientists. The first section will describe alternative accounts of definitions, its two subsections will cover historical and contemporary definitions, and section 2 covers the recent countertrend in skepticism toward definitions of life. Because the various stakeholders have different goals, the second half will focus on those goals. Sections 3, 4, and 5 cover topics that some believe require a definition of life: artificial and synthetic life, the origin(s) of life, and the search for life in the Universe. Section 6 covers entities that are much larger or smaller than organisms, while section 7 covers the role life takes in the context of society, especially with respect to questions raised by new technology. 1.

Definition(s) Few things in biology have been more extensively discussed than the definition of life. It is frustrating so little progress has been made on the topic in the face of so much research, theory, and debate. There are many reasons for this failure: disagreements about how abstract or specific definitions should be, different commitments as to what ought to be included in a definition, and even disagreement about the nature of definitions themselves. This section covers the nature and role of definitions. Each of these has been used in approaching the question of life. Historically, when philosophers and scientists define a concept, the aim is to provide necessary and sufficient conditions. These theoretical definitions (also called real, ideal or philosophical definitions) are often impractical or fragile as they can be challenged with a single imagined counterexample. A classic case is the definition of  bachelors  as  unmarried males. It is trivial to find examples that fit this definition without intuitively being bachelors: male dogs, baby boys, widowers, etc. Similarly, for any definition of life, one can either show living cases that are left out of the definition or non - living cases that are included by it. Life is organized, but so are geological formations. Life processes energy, but so does fire. Life evolves using complex biochemistry, but so do prions. Life is self - sustaining, but parasites are not. Life is at thermodynamic disequilibrium, but so is much else. As we ll see shortly, perhaps theoretical definitions are too rigid a standard. The real world is far too complex for limited criteria to decide every marginal case. Non - philosophers are typically quite frustrated by the back - and - forth that results from theoretical definitions. To that end, some favor operational (or working) definitions, ones that work in practice to narrow down the range of phenomena under consideration. This approach is often not considered a kind of definition by philosophers (see Gupta 2021). Operational definitions tend to be philosophically shallow. For example, NASA s operational definition of life as  a self - sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution  (Joyce 1994) might include viruses while excluding mules. The lack of depth of an operational definition can frustrate theoretically minded people, including other scientists. There are several other conceptions of definition, as well. The nominal (also lexicographer or dictionary) definition is determined by analyzing usage. It will not work for cutting edge or controversial issues because such definitions follow the slow process of cultural acceptance rather than provide guidance to researchers at the forefront of these debates. Scholars are more likely to quote a dictionary definition than be illuminated by one. There are also demonstrative or ostensive definitions, which are concepts we can convey by mere shared observations:  that is red  while pointing at a red object, for instance. Potter Stewart famously defined pornography in this manner by saying  I know it when I see it  (Stewart 1964). Knowledge by ostension may reflect epistemic access to a natural kind, although this may feel indistinguishable from an internalized cultural category. There is huge variation among what scientists consider  life,  even among objects on Earth, like viruses and prions, which suggests this kind of definition is not viable for this target. Then there are stipulative definitions, which are terms introduced and defined by fiat. A circle in Euclidean geometry can be defined as a round plane figure whose boundary consists of infinite points equidistant to a single other point. There are no possible counterexamples to this definition, given the axioms of Euclidean geometry. This approach provides little refuge in the real world. Consider an attempt to define swans as  white birds with long necks. By stipulation, storks, great egrets, and many cranes would be swans, while Australia s black swans would not. Such a quick and dirty definition seems to define the category out of hand and perhaps only works within accepted axioms or theories. Life could be stipulated as  carbon - based reproducing entities,  which would rule out silicon - based life by fiat. Such a definition merely pushes the debate to the scenarios in which the stipulated definition goes against intuitive notions. The 20 th century saw some steps away from definitions toward alternative views of concepts, notably prototypes, exemplars, and theories (Machery 2009). Prototype concepts are abstract features shared by most, but not all members of a category (Rosch   Mervis 1975; Rosch 1978; Hampton 1979, 2006; Smith 2002). The definitions of life in biology textbooks might be charitably understood as prototype concepts. So, too, are the property cluster natural kinds popular in philosophy of biology (Boyd 1991, 1999, 2010; Diguez 2013; Slater 2015). Exemplars are concepts built around similarity to a particular individual case (Medin   Schaffer 1978, Nosofsky 1986). Both prototypes and exemplar concepts rely on similarity to paradigmatic cases, with the former being an imagined ideal and the latter being a real instance (Komatsu 1992). For similarity - based concepts to work in scientific cases such as life, we need an account of which similarities matter, how much, and why. In contrast to similarity - based concepts, the requirements of theory concepts are somewhat more nebulous. Theory concepts are modeled on scientific theories and thus reflect their diversity (Carey 1985, Murphy   Medin 1985, Gopnik   Meltzoff 1997). At the core, theory concepts rely on explanations for why the members of a category share certain properties. Marginal cases of life, such as viruses, prions, or protocells, might be included in some theories of life but not others. In sum, there are many potential approaches to definitions, each with different benefits, drawbacks, and standards of success. Much more could be said about these and other possible approaches, but this will suffice for our purposes. Some of the disagreements about defining life dissolve upon clarifying which type of definition or concept is being used. Many of the explicit attempts to define life have focused on either operational and philosophical definitions, while often not acknowledging or misunderstanding the distinction between these. One will note these two definitions are at cross - purposes   operational definitions can be quick and dirty, but philosophical definitions seek to give necessary and sufficient conditions. Less work has been done on life as a non - definitional concept, although that is perhaps changing. 1.1 Definitions of Life from Antiquity to Darwin This subsection briefly explores historical definitions of life. There are more in depth treatments of the matter, to which an interested reader should turn (Bedau   Cleland 2010, Riskin 2015, Mix 2018). Approaches to this issue vary widely across historians, philosophers, and scientists, so some skepticism about any individual author s approach to the topic is warranted. We begin with the Greeks. In several dialogues, notably the Phaedrus, Timeaus, and Republic, Plato divided life into three parts: vegetable life, animal life, and rational life. All living creatures possessed the first in the form of nutrition and reproduction, animals were additionally capable of sensation and locomotion, and humans also had rational souls. Plato s subsequent influence in Christian theology may be apparent in spirit if not in detail. In Christian theology, human life was not only rational, but also involved an eternal, spiritual soul and an internal, conscious life. Plato s student, Aristotle, had a different notion in which living things had an appropriate form, material, and goal - directedness (De Anima, 412 a 1 416 b). Aristotle held life to be a form of self - motion, perpetuation, or self - alteration (Byers 2006). For Aristotle, the capacity to resist internal and external perturbations was the essential distinction between living beings and non - living objects. Other features were accidental. This quest for demarcating the essential from the accidental for life has persisted to this day in searches for theoretical definitions of life as well as in attacks against those not interested in such definitions. Centuries later, Descartes drew a sharper distinction between animal life and rational life than between inanimate objects and animal life. This was a turn away from medieval approaches, which had taken the gap between vegetables and animals to be broader. For Descartes, animals are analogous to complex clocks and lack the inner or spiritual life central to the human experience (Descartes 2010 1664). As such, Descartes  category of life neither mapped onto Greek conceptions nor current conceptual frameworks. The mechanistic view developed by Descartes and his followers is often thought to be continuous with current scientific thinking, but this is perhaps anachronistic, as much of the theoretical underpinning separating animal life and rational life is no longer accepted. The responses to Descartes came to be grouped under the heading  vitalism. Vitalism, which spanned three centuries, was a heterogenous philosophical position unified by adherents  doubt of a fully mechanistic view of life. Vitalists had ontologies of defining features of life as varied as immaterial causes, particular arrangements of matter, a special life fluid, a particular end goal, or even mental forces. A whiggish history of biology will declare the death of vitalism with Friedrich W hler s synthesis of urea from ammonium cyanate. The suggestion is that if biological chemicals can be produced from mere chemistry, then biology is also mere chemistry. Although this was an important step, many chemists already had accepted a mechanistic world view, and many other researchers continued to develop vitalist theories well into the 20 th century (Bergson 1959, Driesch 1905 1914). 1.2 Contemporary Definitions of Life The 20 th century largely saw the mechanist vitalist divide dissipate. Despite the difficulties described above about definitions, hundreds of scientists, philosophers, and others have tried their hand at defining life. Much of the interest is motivated by new science and new technologies   including artificial life, synthetic biology, origins of life, and astrobiology   which complicate the issue by violating some of the traditional groupings of properties associated with life. There are numerous books, articles, and workshops on the nature of life (P lyi et al. 2002, Popa 2004, Bedau   Cleland 2010). Popa 2004 Trifonov 2011 Malaterre   Chartier 2019 Matter   Energy Mechanistic: pragmatic interpretations that see life as a complex machine, including thermodynamic approaches Energy: relating to terms like force Material - Related: those based on biochemistry and other feature of life on Earth Matter: relating to terms like organic, material, and molecules 1.

Some recent attempts at meta - categories for life definitions. Each column is one account s categories, the rows are lined up according to rough similarity. There are perhaps thousands of competing definitions proposed across hundreds of articles. A true survey of that variety would be beyond the scope of this article and beyond your patience as a reader. Nevertheless, some broad categories have been proposed that might offer some insight into current contending definitions. Table 1 summarizes three of the most rigorous attempts this century to categorize definitions of life. Each of these authors used different approaches to arrive at their categories. Popa 2004 and Trifonov 2011 attempted to reverse engineer the categories from dozens of definitions collected from many dozens of experts, while Malaterre and Chartier 2019 conducted a more extensive, text - mining approach across 30,000 scientific articles selected from journals that published pieces in biology. As one can see, there are areas of rough overlap, but each categorization scheme has its own unique categories as well. Most of the definitions considered by these authors straddle some of these distinctions and are often ambiguous as to whether they are intended to be theoretical definitions, operational definitions, or something else. For example, Popa 2004 considers definitions ranging from Oparin 1961 s  Any system capable of replication and mutation is alive  to Schulze - Makuch et al. 2002: We propose to define living systems as those that are: (1) composed of bounded micro - environments in thermodynamic equilibrium with their surroundings; (2) capable of transforming energy to maintain their low - entropy states; and (3) able to replicate structurally distinct copies of themselves from an instructional code perpetuated indefinitely through time despite the demise of the individual carrier through which it is transmitted. Categorizing definitions such as these necessarily requires some choices and reasonable people can disagree about whether each belongs in one or more categories. The takeaway from current understandings of the definition of life is that there is no consensus forthcoming in the near future. One concern is that these are summaries of attempts to define a category for which there is only loose agreement. Many scientists disagree as to the phenomena a definition of life is intended to unify. Some scientists would include prions, viruses, and entities only hypothesized to exist in the origin of life, while others would completely reject them. Some might accept digital organisms as alive, others would deny this approach. Conceptual equivocation could have significant costs for research. One field recently quantified this cost, suggesting it is more than a merely theoretical concern (Trombley and Cottenie 2019). Given the diversity described above, one may be tempted to adopt a definitional pluralism: there are many ways to be alive. For some reason, that approach is not common in the literature. 2. Definitional Skepticism Nearly everybody agrees there is a distinction between life and non - life, typically understood as a difference in kind rather than one of degree. Furthermore, most people involved accept that life is some sort of natural kind, rather than a human psychological concept. That said, a common theme in recent philosophical work has been to express skepticism of life definitions as a goal. The literature on the definition of life is vast, repetitive, and utterly inconclusive. Philosophers have disagreed as to the ultimate source of the lack of consensus, citing unstated assumptions in either the definer s approach or the question itself. Note that many scientists are less likely to be skeptical of the goal of defining life, though also more resistant to engaging in the philosophical debate. One skeptical view has arisen from the observation that theoretical definitions of life presume a theory of life (Cleland and Chyba 2002, Benner 2010, Cleland 2019). Although it is not obvious that the authors allude to the theory - theory of concepts, described in section 1, a common analogy is to early chemical theory. According to this analogy, early alchemists likened the alchemists  Aqua regia ( royal water ) and Aqua fortis ( strong water ). Development of atomic theory revealed, Cleland argues, that the true nature of water was H 2 O, while the other  waters  were HNO 3   3 HCl and HNO 3, respectively. Cleland advocates avoiding definitions altogether, fearing they will blind us to new instances of life, and instead opts for tentative criteria, which she believes avoid the implicit dogma of even operational definitions. Other authors have pointed out that the explanandum of life is itself up for debate (Tsokolov 2009, Mix 2020, Parke 2020). According to Emily Parke, some accept life as applying to individuals, whereas other definitions apply to collectives first (including entire planets) and individuals derivatively. Relatedly, most believe life is some kind of entity rather than some kind of relation or process (but see Nicholson and Dupr  2018). Parke also points out that some definitions seek a material basis, perhaps limiting life s substrate to the biochemistry we know on Earth, while others are functional. Sagan famously worried about biochemical definitions because they were prone to  Earth Chauvinism  for privileging our own biochemistry (1970). Other authors take our biochemistry to be independently justified as universal (Pace 2001, Benner et al. 2004, but see Bains 2004). Finally, Parke distinguishes between those that seek clean boundaries and those that accept the possibility of a continuum of  lifelikeness. Other authors have advocated a kind of quietism about definitions, maintaining that folk concepts need not match up with scientific ones (Machery 2011), any definitions would not change scientific practice (Szostak 2012), advocated a radical conceptual rethinking (Mariscal   Doolittle 2020), or denied the distinction between life   non - life entirely (Jabr 2013). This last position of eliminativism could be expanded as it helps illustrate all other life skeptical positions. Cowie 2009 classifies eliminativist goals as either linguistic or ontological. Ontological eliminativists don t believe the objects they are eliminating truly exist. We re all eliminativists about something, perhaps ghosts or fairies. Linguistic conceptual eliminativists, on the other hand are merely suspicious of theoretical terms or concepts, what Ramsey 2020 calls  category dissolution  or  conceptual fragmentation. In essence, it s not that there aren t living things, it s just that the category life is heterogeneous rather than a natural kind. According to Cowie, one can deny that anything matching our theoretical definition of life actually exists in the world while still accepting it as a useful fiction. Conversely, one may think scientific theories about life are fruitless or that the term is too vague and confused to be useful, without doubting life exists. If we accept any of these alternatives, we should perhaps avoid ever using the term  life  in isolation and instead reference Metabolic Life and Evolutionary Life and all the other conceptions. At play in these various forms of skepticism are several underlying assumptions. Among other disagreements, researchers disagree about what life is, whether it is a natural kind with an essence or a human construct; they disagree as to the purpose of defining life, especially if it will not change scientific practice; and they disagree as to the features of life that are relevant and the ones that are mere consequences. When researchers hold unstated assumptions such as these, they are liable to mistake the source of their disagreement. 3. Artificial and Synthetic Life The rest of this article will focus on uses of the various life concepts. Some of the definitions described above are derived from, or necessary for, specific scientific and societal purposes. This section focuses on artificial and synthetic life. In principle, most contemporary scientists and philosophers believe life can be created, but there is broad disagreement as to what needs to be recreated for something to be life. In functional approaches, mere formal organization sufficiently similar to organisms may be enough. Complexly configured robots ( hardware ) or computer programs ( software ) might qualify. This view is known as Strong Artificial Life (A - Life for short) and has received much of the same pushback as the Strong Artificial Intelligence approach before it (Sober 1991, Boden 1999, Brooks 2001). Those who reject the Strong A - Life view believe that functional approaches miss some of the essential features of biology for either epistemic or ontological reasons. Epistemic objections might be consistent with the possibility of Strong A - Life, but doubt that we have the knowledge to recreate the relevant biological functions in a digital framework. Conversely, most of the objections to Strong A - Life have been ontological, resting on the view that representations cannot be equivalent to that which they represent and that perhaps life requires chemical embodiment, ruling Strong A - Life impossible by fiat. Weak A - Life approaches, on the other hand, don t presume the ontological equivalence of structurally similar circuits and cells. Instead, proponents suggest the more modest goal of developing a deeper understanding of life as we know it by exploring the effects of various parameters in simulations, effectively placing life in a broader context of possible biology (Langton 1989, 1995). For example, in the Terra program, software was pitted against other software for processing power (Ray 1993). Unexpected by the researchers at the time, software parasitism evolved: software would co - opt the reproductive processing of other software. Policing mechanisms also evolved, leading to an arms race between free - riders and the software trying to stop them. Whether one accepts the strong or weak interpretation of A - Life, these in silico approaches are cheaper than equivalent work done in real organisms. They also offer possibilities that are not available in ordinary biology, such as programming alternative parameters to take the place of laws of nature and exploring relationships across deep time and space quickly and efficiently. Another approach worth highlighting is that of synthetic life ( wetware ). Less conceptually troubled, synthetic life can also address some questions of A - Life, while allowing for a finer grain of realism. Synthetic life approaches have explored creating self - replication (Lincoln   Joyce 2009), minimal genomes (Koonin 2000, Hutchinson et al. 2016), a chemical evolution (Gromski et al. 2020), and other projects. Not all synthetic biology is in the business of investigating life as it could be, as not all computer programming is A - Life. Nevertheless, the tools developed by both can be illuminating. By exploring possibilities, scientists can discover previously hidden relationships, revealing which aspects of life are more or less plausible than expected. 4. Origin(s) of Life Inextricable from the question of life s nature is the question of its origin. Ancient and modern thinkers accepted that life often arose spontaneously from non - life. Two centuries of experiments eventually overturned this widely accepted view, culminating in Louis Pasteur s swan - neck bottle experiments. Since then, the puzzle of Life s origin has been one of the biggest and most important in all of science. Darwin was famously silent about the problem, although in a letter to his friend Joseph Hooker, Darwin confided that he imagined life originating in  some warm little pond  (see Other Internet Resources below; and Peret  et al. 2009). Subsequent work on the subject was sparse until the 1920 s when Alexander Oparin and J. B. S. Haldane independently proposed hypotheses for life s origin in then plausible early Earth conditions (Haldane 1929; Oparin 2010 1936). As a graduate student in the 1950 s, Stanley Miller tested the proposal, discovering dozens of amino acids in the mixture (1953). Since then, the field of origins - of - life studies has expanded dramatically. Our earliest reliable records of this planet, some 3.5 billion years ago, contain distinctive evidence of microbial fossils, including distinctive shapes that correlate to the sizes and shapes of current prokaryotes, as well as carbon - ratios distinctive to life as we know it (Schopf 1993, Schopf et al. 2017). Many analyses have pushed our confidence in life s earlier origin significantly further back, suggesting that basically as soon as Earth was not molten, it was filled with life (Pearce et al. 2018, Lineweaver 2020). How life started and why it started so quickly remains one of the most pressing open questions in science. There are many open philosophical issues in origins of life research. Several of these are centered around the explanandum in question and epistemological limits to our knowledge. Researchers differ, for example, as to whether the purpose of origins - of - life research is to discover how life could have originated or how it did originate (Scharf et al. 2015, Mariscal et al. 2019). Some steps in the process could have been chancy, others could have been deterministic but highly contingent, still others could have been the only way life ever originates anywhere in the Universe. There are several broad approaches to investigating the origin of life. Bottom - Up  approaches begin with pre - biotic chemistry and explore how it could withstand stressors in order for lifelike entities to form and evolve. At present, there are many unsolved problems, most notably that most energetically favorable interactions would consume the proto - life forms involved. Scientists have cleverly attempted to ease the problem by relaxing assumptions: perhaps the environment provided our first boundaries (Koonin 2009), or perhaps it provided porto - genetic material (Mathis et al. 2017), all of this could have occurred in a viscous solvent instead of a cell (He et al. 2017), or on a surface (W chtersh user 1988), or using a variety of entities that eventually became encapsulated (Eigen   Schuster 1977). Nevertheless, the gulf between the pre - biotic chemistry and the simplest life forms is still huge and any number of explanations only account for a tiny portion of the conceptual distance. Another approach,  Top - Down,  uses current taxa to infer the nature and timing of the origin of life on Earth. To do so, we take current examples of life on Earth and trace their ancestry, by comparing the nearly hundred shared genes, primarily associated with biological translation (Koonin 2011). All life shares a last universal common ancestor,  LUCA  for short. There may have been several origins of life, but our evidence is insufficient to distinguish this scenario from a single origin. Nevertheless, at least one origin, presumably in Earthly pre - biotic conditions, led to the existence of LUCA, an important constraint upon theorizing about the origin of life. It is widely expected that LUCA was merely one creature in a larger population and existed long after the origin of the first organism. There are also a variety of concerns with respect to LUCA: whether it was simple or complex (Mariscal   Doolittle 2015); whether it had a membrane that resembled any of the current membranes (Koonin 2011); whether the genes it contained were ancestors of our own genes or subsequently acquired (Doolittle   Brown 1994, Woese   Fox 1977; Woese 1998); whether its genome was made of DNA (Forterre 2006 a), whether it was a heterotroph or autotroph; where it lived; and when it lived. The gap between Top - Down and Bottom - Up approaches is huge: untold generations passed between pre - biotic chemistry and LUCA. We may never be able to solve Life s origin, but each step brings us closer to understanding the trajectory. 5. Search For Life Even the most pessimistic analyses of the likelihood of life suggests life on Earth is not unique (Frank   Sullivan 2016). Many scientists take that as a good reason to search for life elsewhere in the Universe. The current search for life elsewhere focuses on two extremes: the chemical byproducts of life and the technological signals of intelligent life. The social interactions of alien populations might be interesting, but they are hard to study as of yet. Thus, we search for biosignatures that might uniquely identify life from a great distance. We ll take each in turn. Biosignatures, as the name implies, are purported to be markers of life. Chemical biosignatures are compounds either rarely or never produced without the assistance of life on Earth. Finding biosignatures thus implies a material conception of life, likely in the form of biochemistry, metabolism, or thermodynamics. There have been many attempts to detect biosignatures, primarily on Mars. These approaches include experiments done on planetary surfaces, observations from Earth or low - earth orbit, and study of meteors and other debris from nearby planetary bodies. More practically, satellite or telescope observations of other planets have been used to search for gasses outside of thermodynamic equilibrium. Methane has been sporadically detected on Mars since 2004 (Formisano et al. 2004, Webster et al. 2018) with an accompanying claim of formaldehyde detection (Peplow 2005). Venus has also been a source of attention, with phosphine gas detected in the clouds above Venus (Greaves et al. 2020). A controversial finding, it nevertheless caught the scientific imagination. Future scientific research is expected to accelerate this method of observation, especially with new data gathered by the new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). With its equipment, JWST is able to image exoplanets at resolutions allowing the detection of gas biomarkers in the atmospheres of exoplanets (Loeb   Maoz 2013). By contrast, there have been scarce attempts to detect chemical life while on the surface of another planet. In 1975, NASA sent the Viking landers to Mars, tasked with a variety of scientific experiments including some that were purported to detect life if it was present. One, the Labeled Release Experiment, did, but its results were inconsistent with the other on - board experiments, so the result was deemed inconclusive (Levin   Straat 1976, Ezell   Ezell 1984). The current Perseverence rover on Mars is able to assess certain biosignatures and upcoming missions by NASA, the Chinese National Space Administration, and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency all seek to determine whether Mars has evidence of past or current life. It is not obvious that life on Mars would be a separate origin than life on Earth, as the two planets exchange tons of rocks each year and it is at least theoretically possible that life could have formed on one planet and been subsequently transferred to the other (McKay 2010). Since Mars is a smaller body than Earth, it coalesced before Earth and thus it is conceivable that life might have formed there first, although this is a relatively marginal view in the astrobiology community. Meteorites from Mars and other planetary bodies have also been the source of purported biosignatures. The Martian meteorite ALH 84001 was instrumental in forming the science of astrobiology in 1996, after NASA scientists discovered bacteria - like structures (McKay et al. 1996). Subsequent meteorites have also garnered scientific interest (e.g. White et al. 2014). The other major attempt to search for life, that of searching for intelligence, more readily captures the imagination. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) has been ongoing for centuries (Dick 1982). Fierce debates between those that took Earth to be unique and those that took it to be one of a plurality of worlds persisted for millennia (and still do, to some extent). Advocates of the plurality of worlds view searched their telescopes for evidence. A famous instance is Percival Lowell s drawings of Martian canals in the 1890 s. Influenced by the mid - 1800 s observations of what appeared to be channels criss - crossing Mars, Lowell drew a series of canals based on his observations. Science fiction soon picked up the observation and conjectured a dying civilization, hoping to squeeze water out of the last bits of remaining ice in the Martian poles. Partially driven by the science fiction following Lowell s drawings, the early 20 th century saw increased interest in detecting radio signals from Outer Space. This interest accelerated after the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and was more systematically and formally approached starting in the late 1970 s. SETI research has not been publicly funded since 1994, but private and public donors, as well as academic and lay researchers have kept the program going since. There are many technical challenges to the search: space is unimaginably huge, signals are weak, possibilities of interstellar communication are myriad, and our searches can only cover an insignificant portion of the task. More controversially, many dozens of messages have been sent into Outer Space since 1974. A few have been in the form of physical objects aboard spacecraft, but most have been radio signals aimed at promising stars or star clusters. sometimes called Active SETI or METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence). Although the practice continues due to its low cost and relative ease, many philosophers, scientists, and policy experts have come out against the practice largely due to the risk of broadcasting our presence to potentially hostile forces on behalf of future generations that cannot consent (Smith 2020). 6. The Macro and the Micro Perspectives Scientists grow more concerned about philosophical questions when scientific limitations or conceptual choices are made apparent to them. Those scientists who study deep time, deep space, abstract issues, or questions of ethics are often keenly aware of the philosophical choices that influence their research from identification of research question to interpretation of the data. This section briefly goes through other scientific contexts in which how life is defined is relevant, which address scales well below and well above the organism level. There are several biological entities for which it is an open question as to whether they are alive. Viruses, for example, are units of genetic material encased in a protein coat. It is unknown whether all viruses share common ancestor (Koonin et al. 2006, Moreira and L pez Garcia 2009) nor how they originated, be it escaped transposable elements, reduced cells, or some ancestral third option (Forterre 2006 b). The status of viruses as living is mired with controversy, with some people holding virons to be alive, others believing them not to be, and a third camp has them as living only in the context of an infected cell, but a mere  seed  otherwise (Forterre 2010). There are other entities in the  twilight zone of microbiology,  including transposable elements, viroids, unculturable (but putatively existing) microbes, organisms in vegetative states, and prions (Postgate 1999). The problems facing each of these are similar: several of them can evolve by natural selection, are biochemically complex, but lack other properties associated with life. For example, prions are protein products of life that can fold other prions in a way that allows for cumulative evolution (Li et al. 2010). They are rarely included in the category  life  due to their inactivity in most settings and rather simple origin as a misfold of a functional protein. If there is a twilight zone of microbiology, there is also a twilight zone of ecology. Organisms form populations, species, lineages, clades, and ecosystems. The status of each of these is an open question, but they have many of the same features associated with life as described above. Perhaps the strongest case can be made for eusocial insects, such as some ants, bees, wasps, and termites. In several species, there are rigid distinctions between the castes that reproduce and those that do not, with many of the latter serving the role of caring for the young (H lldobler   Wilson 2009). One might note that entities above the organism level are as a rule less integrated and connected than the organisms that comprise them. This is perhaps a general feature of life: from the perspective of every item in the biological hierarchy, its parts are much more homogenous than it is. Our cells seem much more integrated and self - contained than our bodies, so, too, are individual insects more self - contained than the colonies to which they belong. Most controversial has been the case of Gaia. Gaia is a term from Greek mythology; she is a personification of the planet Earth. In 1979, James Lovelock, revived the concept in his book, Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth. In his view, the Earth - wide set of interlocking ecosystems could be viewed as a single entity. One insight of Lovelock s was already mentioned in the previous section: planet - wide interactions are the scale that matters in detecting life elsewhere. Lovelock s book sparked controversy centered around the plausibility of his model of the Earth as a self - regulating homeostatic system. In the view of many at the time, it was an inaccurate description: Earth could not evolve in principle, and the subsequent ontological move of granting Earth the status of life was unmotivated (Doolittle 1981). Recent attempts to revitalize the notion of Gaia on a more theoretic footing involve both abiotic and biotic regulatory mechanisms and natural selection acting at the level of clades (Lenton et al. 2018, Doolittle 2019). Regardless of current attempts at a theoretical justification, the thought of Earth as a living entity motivated many in the environmental movement and the idea remains a common reference. 7. Ethics, Law, and Politics The term  life  is important outside of biology. Often, the focus is not on the concept of life or life in general, but on the status of individual living entities. Typically, the focus is on the beginning and end stages of individual lives, which raises legal, religious, and moral questions. The start of an individual life has been the source of contraception and abortion discussions (Noonan 1967, Dellapenna 1978). Unfortunately, developmental biology does not provide an uncontroversial starting point for when  life  begins (Maienschein 2014). The end of individual lives was also a heated debate in the 20 th century as new technologies were able to keep human bodies alive long after they would have died in nature (DeGrazia 2016). Any discussion of defining life in these contexts should begin by distinguishing between life and other phenomena that are often conflated with it in public discourse, such as sentience, personhood, and moral considerability. It s unclear how much ontological, epistemic, or moral weight the category of life has independently of other properties. Attributing moral worth to non - living entities is still a minority position in environmental or comparative philosophy (but see Leopold 1949, Basl 2019). Thus, a starting position might be that life is a prerequisite for moral considerability. Nonetheless, most humans don t mind killing bacteria for the sake of cleanliness and many people eat or wear the flesh of animals. So, in many discussions, life is only valuable when it is the vehicle for other equally nebulous properties like sentience, personhood, or immaterial souls. If any living entities have a distinct moral or ontological status, most philosophers would accept that humans are among them (Rolston 1975, Goodpaster 1978). In these contexts, it matters when individual humans come into being and acquire such a status in their own right, be it conception, birth, or some time period in between. Considered opinions differ as to when this occurs and in virtue of what, be it mere possibility of self - sustained life, sentience, or other features. There is still a rampant pro - life pro - choice split in cultural politics, which is somewhat lessened in European countries (Corbella 2020). There are equivalent, but less tendentious analogues in the contexts of euthanasia, the death penalty, war, and the prevention of death and disease. In these debates, both ethical and metaphysical commitments matter. The public questions of life are often raised by new technologies. In the abortion discussion above, for example, new techniques to end pregnancies, from birth control to abortion procedures, as well as new medical technologies facilitating premature deliveries made the topic more contentious. Other technological innovations also raise questions about life. One such area is that of transhumanism (c.f. More and Vita - More 2013). Transhumanism is the movement aimed toward the use of technology for the human enhancement of social, psychological, and physical lives. These can range from prosthetics to implants or from pharmaceuticals to mental  uploading. There are bioconservatives, who argue against transhumanism for practical, moral, or aesthetic reasons. There are also posthumanists, who look forward to a world in which humans are replaced or eliminated by subsequent artificial intelligence. The debate over whether such posthumans might be  alive  is similar in structure to the artificial life discussion in section 3. Bioconservatives also argue against this view. Among the topics in these debates are whether a particular technology counts as therapy or enhancement, whether the risks of alteration outweigh the benefits, whether certain goals of transhumanism are even possible, and which alterations will affect the moral or ontological status of the people that receive them. That life is a source of ethical, legal, and political controversy is to be expected. And although it is beyond the scope of this article to adjudicate these debates, advocates ought to be aware of the deep vagueness in biology and disagreement within philosophy with respect to what life is, what an individual living organism is, when individual lives begin or end, and what features of life ground moral considerability. 8. Conclusion Although the conceptual terrain of life concepts is well covered, there is no accepted view as yet. This is unlikely to change given the disciplinary backgrounds, explanatory values, and theoretical commitments of the stakeholders involved. A wide range of practices rely on competing conceptions of life: including artificial life, origins - of - life research, the search for life, and other projects described above. Future scientific discoveries or inventions may break this impasse, as they have in other cases of theoretical gridlock. The development of atomic theory, discussed in section 2, created new categorical divisions that scientists accepted as more real than the categories of the ancients or alchemists. With this conceptual fragmentation, old categories were discarded and new ones accepted. One can imagine something similar happening in the case of life: many discoveries might show a clear cluster of how complex, lifelike entities can form from prebiotic chemistry, eventually winning over the majority of the scientific and philosophical community (e.g. Weber 2007, 2010). Conversely, a simple decision might be made based on shared values or explanatory goals. The example of death may be illustrative. After decades of debate, a new decision, not a discovery, was made. Physicians concluded the irreversibility of death was the most important property for their purposes. They adopted the concept of whole - brain death as their operational criterion (DeGrazia 2016). The facts on the ground did not change, but the shared understanding did. Finally, perhaps life will be accepted as a polysemous concept with each definitional cluster applying to a subset of the whole: biochemical life, evolutionary life, metabolic life, etc. Researchers may rely on context, accept some miscommunication, or simply stipulate the kind of life they mean. The example of planets, discussed in Brusse 2016 may help make this point. There was always a huge diversity within the category planet, which included the Sun and Moon until the Renaissance. In the early 1800 s, asteroids were discovered. Initially, they were considered planets, they were demoted to  minor  planets a few decades later, then simply  asteroids  after the 1950 s. Pluto was discovered in 1930, recognized as the smallest planet by the 1970 s. From 1992 until 2006, many objects similar to Pluto were discovered until astronomers decided that the term planet actually covered at least two distinct, but scientifically interesting categories: typical planets and dwarf planets. Similarly, perhaps some of the categories described in section 1.2 will form the basis of accepted sub - categories of life. It is still an open question as to how long the current situation will persist before a discovery forces a scientific reckoning or a decision obviates the need. For now, the debate continues.

    "ai_overview": "Different philosophical traditions approach the meaning of life from diverse perspectives. Here's a summary of some key viewpoints:\n* **Ancient Greek Philosophy:**\n* **Platonism:** The meaning of life is in attaining the highest form of knowledge, the Idea of the Good, from which all good and just things derive utility and value.\n* **Aristotelianism:** Achieving eudaimonia, often translated as happiness, well-being, flourishing, and excellence, is the highest good.\n* **Cynicism:** Living a life of virtue in agreement with nature is the purpose of life. Happiness depends on self-sufficiency and control over one's mental attitude.\n* **Cyrenaicism:** Pleasure is the supreme good.\n* **Epicureanism:** Seeking modest pleasures to attain tranquility and freedom from fear (ataraxia). Freedom from pain and fear is happiness in its highest form.\n* **Stoicism:** Living according to reason and virtue is to be in harmony with the universe's divine order. Meaning is \"freedom from suffering\" through objectivity and clear judgment.\n* **Enlightenment Philosophy:** Focuses on the relationship between individuals and their society, emphasizing natural rights and the potentialities of reason.\n* **Kantianism:** Adhering to the categorical imperative and acting in accordance with duty.\n* **19th-Century Philosophy:**\n* **Utilitarianism:** The meaning of life is the \"greatest happiness principle,\" aiming to bring the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people.\n* **Nihilism:** Life is without objective meaning, a concept that Friedrich Nietzsche explored, suggesting it should be overcome by creating new values.\n* **20th-Century Philosophy:**\n* **Pragmatism:** The practical and useful understanding of life is more important than searching for an impractical abstract truth.\n* **Theism:** Meaning and purpose are found in God's purpose in creating the universe and humanity.\n* **Existentialism:** Each person creates the essence of their life. Ethical directives are action, freedom, and decision.\n* **Absurdism:** Acceptance of the Absurd and continuing to live in spite of it.\n* **Secular Humanism:** Values and realities are derived from human need and interest as tested by experience.\n* **Logical Positivism:** The question \"What is the meaning of life?\" is meaningless because it is a misuse of language.\n* **East Asian Philosophical Perspectives:**\n* **Mohism:** The purpose of life is universal, impartial love.\n* **Confucianism:** Achieving virtue through strong relationships and reasoning while minimizing negative influences.\n* **Taoism: All sentient beings and all men should return to the primordial or to rejoin with the Oneness of the Universe by self-cultivation and self-realization.\n* **Religious Perspectives:**\n* **Judaism:** Elevating the physical world and preparing it for the messianic era through adherence to God's laws and ethical actions.\n* **Christianity:** Seeking divine salvation through faith in God and the intercession of Christ.\n* **Islam:** Worshipping Allah, following divine guidelines revealed in the Qur'an, and acting righteously to attain closeness to Allah in the afterlife.\n* **Hinduism:** Tied to karma, samsara (the cycle of birth and rebirth), and moksha (liberation).\n* **Jainism:** Achieving self-realization and bliss through self-conquest and freedom from external objects.\n* **Buddhism:** Ending suffering and achieving Nirvana through embracing mindfulness and seeing the causes of ill-being and well-being.\n* **Sikhism:** Understanding God and discovering the divinity within each individual.\n* **Zoroastrianism:** Actively participating in the universal conflict between good and evil with good thoughts, words, and deeds.",

    "content": "The Meaning of Life: Early Continental and Analytic Perspectives The question of the meaning of life is one that interests philosophers and non - philosophers alike. The question itself is notoriously ambiguous and possibly vague. In asking about the meaning of life, one may be asking about the essence of life, about life s purpose, about whether and how anything matters, or a host of other things. Not everyone is plagued by questions about life s meaning, but some are. The circumstances in which one does ask about life s meaning include those in which: one is well off but bothered by either a sense of dissatisfaction or the prospect of bad things to come; one is young at heart and has a sense of wonder; one is perplexed by the discordant plurality of things and wants to find some unity in all the diversity; or one has lost faith in old values and narratives and wants to know how to live in order to have a meaningful life. We may read our ancestors in such a way that warrants the claim that the meaning of life has been a human concern from the beginning. But it was only early in the nineteenth century that writers began to write directly about  the meaning of life. The most significant writers were: Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Tolstoy. Schopenhauer ended up saying that the meaning of life is to deny it; Kierkegaard, that the meaning of life is to obey God passionately; Nietzsche, that the meaning of life is the will to power; and Tolstoy, that the meaning of life lies in a kind of irrational knowledge called  faith. In the twentieth century, in the Continental tradition, Heidegger held that the meaning of life is to live authentically or (alternatively) to be a guardian of the earth. Sartre espoused the view that life is meaningless but urged us nonetheless to make a free choice that would give our lives meaning and responsibility. Camus also thought that life is absurd and meaningless. The best way to cope with this fact, he held, is to live life with passion, using everything up, and with an attitude of revolt, defiance, or scorn. In the Anglo - American tradition, William James held that life is meaningful and worth living because of a spiritual order in which we should believe, or else that it is meaningful when there is a marriage of ideals with pluck, will, and the manly virtues; Bertrand Russell argued that to live a meaningful life one must abandon private and petty interests and instead cultivate an interest in the eternal; Moritz Schlick argued that the meaning of life is to be found in play; and A. J. Ayer asserted that the question of the meaning of life is itself meaningless. All of these set the table for a veritable feast of philosophical writing on the meaning of life that began in the 1950 s with Kurt Baier s essay  The Meaning of Life,  followed in 1970 by Richard Taylor s influential essay on the same topic, followed shortly by Thomas Nagel s important 1971 essay on  The Absurd. See  Meaning of Life: The Analytic Perspective  for more on the course of the debate in analytic philosophy about the meaning of life.

Background a. The Origin of the English Expression  the Meaning of Life  The English term  meaning  dates back to the fourteenth century C. E. Its origins, according to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), lie in the Middle English word  meenyng  (also spelled  menaynge,   meneyng,  and  mennyng ). In its earliest occurrences, in English original compositions as well as in English translations of earlier works, meaning is most often what, on the one hand, sentences, utterances, and stories, and, on the other hand, dreams, visions, signs, omens, and rituals have or might have. One asks about the meaning of some puzzling utterance, or of the writing on the wall, or of the vision that appeared to somebody in the night, or of the ritual performed on a hallowed occasion. Meaning is often conceived of as something non - obvious and somewhat secretive, discernible only by a seer granted with special powers. It is much later that life is spoken of as something that might, or might not, have meaning in this sense. Such speech would have to wait upon the development of the concept of life as something like a word, a linguistic utterance, a narrative, a story, a gesture, a puzzling episode, a sign, a dream, a vision, or a surface phenomenon that points to some deep inner essence, to which it would be proper to inquire into its meaning, or to apply epithets like  meaningful  or  meaningless. One of the earliest instances of the occurrence of the concept  life  as such a thing, as signifying something that might or might not have something like meaning, appears in Shakespeare s Macbeth (c. 1605), where Macbeth characterizes life as  a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. But notice that even here the words  meaning  and  life  are not linked. The OED s definition of  meaning  in something like our sense is  The significance, purpose, underlying truth, etc., of something. Further elaboration of early uses of the word gives us,  That which is indicated or expressed by a (supposed) symbol or symbolic action; spec. a message, warning, idea, etc., supposed to be symbolized by a dream, vision, omen, etc. A bit later, in one of its senses, meaning takes on the sense in which it is the  signification; intention; cause, purpose; motive, justification,  . . .   o f an action, condition, etc. Finally we get the sense that most nearly concerns us here:  Something which gives one a sense of purpose, value, etc., esp. of a metaphysical or spiritual kind; the (perceived) purpose of existence or of a person s life. Freq. in the meaning of life.  (All this is from the OED.) The first English use of the expression  the meaning of life  appeared in 1834 in Thomas Carlyle s (1795 - 1881) Sartor Resartus II. ix, where Teufelsdrockh observes,  our Life is compassed round with Necessity; yet is the meaning of Life itself no other than Freedom. The usage shortly caught on, and over the next century and a half the phrase  the meaning of life  became common. The adjective  meaningful  did not appear until 1852, the noun  meaningfulness  until 1904. b. Questions about the Meaning of Life The most familiar form of the question(s) about the meaning of life is simply,  What is the meaning of life? Although the form of the question is one, when it is asked, any one (or more) of several different senses may be intended. Here are some of the more common of them. (1) In some cases, what the seeker seeks is the kernel, the inner reality, the core, or the essence, underlying some phenomenon. Thus one might ask what his essence, his true self is, and then feel that he has found the meaning of his life if he discovers that true self. (2) In other cases, the question is about the point, aim, object, purpose, end, or goal of life, typically one s own. Here, in some cases, the question is about some pre - existing purpose that the questioner might (or might not) discover; in other cases, the question might be about some end or purpose the agent might invent or create and give her life. The latter questioner, when she is successful, may believe that her life has a meaning because she herself has given it one. (3) In yet other cases, the question of the meaning of life is that of whether our lives, and anything we do within them, matter, or have any sort of importance. If one can show that they matter, and in virtue of what they do, one will have provided a substantive answer to the question of the meaning of life. A common, but not universal, assumption on this score is that our lives have significance and importance only if they issue in some lasting achievement the ravages of time will not destroy. (4) In still other cases, what bothers the questioner is the discord, plurality, and chaotic nature of his apparent empirical life as it is actually lived. He can make no sense of it; there is no rhyme or reason to it. The drive here, one might well think, is to see one s life as intelligible, as something that makes sense. The discovery or invention of some kind of unity in his life would amount to an answer to his question,  What is the meaning of life?  (5) Yet another thing the question about the meaning of life can be is a request for a narrative or picture, a way of seeing life (perhaps a metaphorical one) that enables one to make sense of it and achieve a sense of meaning while living it. And so we get  Life is a bowl of cherries  and various and sundry religious narratives. (6) Sometimes what the questioner is really wondering is whether it makes sense to go on and his question is  Is life worth living? He may actually be contemplating suicide. His predicament has to do with meaning if he is assuming that it makes sense to continue living only if (his) life has a suitable meaning, something which, at the moment, he can t see it as having. (7) Finally, the question of the meaning of life can be the question of how one should live in order to have a meaningful life, or, if such a life is impossible, then what the best way to live meaninglessly is. The seven questions just distinguished may be, but need not be, discrete and self - contained. A given seeker may very well be interested in several of them at once and see them as intimately connected. For example, a person may be interested in his core or essence because he thinks that knowledge of that may reveal the goal or purpose of his life, a purpose that makes his life seem important and intelligible, and gives him a reason for going on, as well as insight into how he must live in order to have a meaningful life. It is commonly the case that several of the questions press themselves on the seeker all at the same time. One or more of these questions were of concern to the philosophers discussed below. Some were concerned with nearly all of them. Distinct from all the above are second - order, analytic, conceptual questions of the sort that dominate current philosophical discussion of the issue in analytic circles. These questions are not so much about the meaning of life as about the meaning of  the meaning of life  and its component concepts ( meaning,   life ), or related ones ( meaningfulness,   meaninglessness,   vanity,   absurdity,  and so forth). c. The Broader Historical Background Although nineteenth century thinkers were the first in the West to put the question precisely in the form  What is the meaning of life?  concern with questions in what may be called  the meaning - of - life family,  that is, ultimate questions about life, the world, existence, and its purpose may be found, in the East and the West alike, almost as far back as we can trace human thought about anything. Thus Gilgamesh (c. 2000 B. C. E.) asked why he must die; the composers of The Rig Veda (c. 1200 B. C. E.) wondered where everything came from; Job (c. 500 B. C. E.) asked why he must suffer; the ancient Taoists (Laozi c. 500 B. C. E. and Zhuangzi c. 300 B. C. E.) asked what the origin or principle of everything is, and how one must live to be in accord with it; ancient Upanishadic seekers (500 - 300 B. C. E.) were much vexed with the nature of the true self and its end or goal; the Buddha (c. 500 B. C. E.), before he became the Buddha, sought an understanding of life that would enable one to overcome suffering; the author of The Bhagavad Gita (c. 200 B. C. E.) was concerned, as other Indian thinkers tended to be, with the identity and nature of the true self, and also with the question of how to live; the ancient Greeks of the classical period (c. 430 - 320 B. C. E.) talked about the goal or end of life and how to reach it; Epicurus (341 - 270 B. C. E.) followed suit and developed his own unique take on these matters; Qoheleth, the author of Ecclesiastes (c. 200 B. C. E.), was struck by the vanity or futility of everything and wondered how to deal with it; Greek and Roman Hellenistic philosophers (c. 300 B. C. E.   250 C. E.) Epicurean, Stoic, Cynic, Skeptic, and Neo - Platonist wondered about the good and how to achieve it; Marcus Aurelius (121 - 180 C. E.) mused on his cosmic insignificance. The Christian - dominated medieval period did not produce thinkers who asked in any radical way about the meaning of life, because everyone already had a perfectly good answer, the one provided by the Christian story. Still, even in medieval times, there was room for at least three questions in the meaning - of - life family. First, there was occasion for the questions when things ran counter to the Christian story, or to what one expected. Thus Boethius (480 - 525) was perplexed by the deep questions when, after a life of honor, piety, and power, he fell into disgrace, had everything stripped from him unaccountably and unjustly, and found himself faced with imprisonment that lead eventually to his execution. Second, though the great Christian philosopher - theologians thought they knew the meaning of life in outline, they still asked and answered questions about the details of the final or highest good of man. Thomas Aquinas (1224 - 1274), for example, who accepted with unblinking assurance the general answer supplied by Christianity, found himself wondering about the exact nature of the summum bonum (the highest good) and about how to square the Christian view of it with that of Aristotle. Third, other Christian believers, medieval ones as well as present - day ones with medieval outlooks, committed to an overall view of what is going on, may be vexed by the question of what God intends for them specifically and may worry about their  calling,  the particular purpose, role, or plan God has especially for them. Hence we find confirmed believers worried deeply about the question,  What is the meaning of my life? In any event, since the early modern period, there has been a resurgence of interest in fundamental meaning - of - life questions. Writers as diverse as Shakespeare (1564 - 1616), Pascal (1623 - 1662), Dr. Johnson (1709 - 84), Kant (1724 - 1804), and Hegel (1770 - 1831) have asked, in different forms, questions about life s ultimate point, goal, or purpose, and they are just a few of the many religious, philosophical, and literary figures who have raised and (sometimes) answered ultimate questions in the meaning - of - life family prior to Schopenhauer s work early in the nineteenth century. There have been philosophers too since Schopenhauer s time who have addressed the big questions, but not explicitly in terms of  the meaning of life. This article will confine itself largely to those philosophers who have explicitly put their concerns in those terms. The standard explanation of the rise of questions about life s meaning in the early modern period points to three or four distinct but related things: (1) the scientific revolution; (2) the Protestant Reformation; (3) voyages and travels of exploration and discovery, in which were encountered peoples with very different outlooks on the nature of the universe and the meaning of life; and (4), as a result of all of these, the evaporation of a widely held, firmly believed Christian conception of the nature of things. 2. Nineteenth Century Philosophers Let us turn now to the story of what philosophers from Schopenhauer in the early 1800 s to Ayer and Camus in the 1940 s have had to say about the meaning of life. a. Schopenhauer The first Western philosopher to link the ideas of life and meaning, and to ask expressly  What is the meaning of life?  was the great German pessimist Arthur Schopenhauer (1788 - 1860). At least he was the first to ask the question and get it noticed by other philosophers. Schopenhauer, a contemporary of Carlyle, wrote in German, in which  the meaning of life  is  der Sinn des Lebens. Profoundly influencing the thought of both Nietzsche and Tolstoy, Schopenhauer s work may be regarded as the springboard that launched modern Western philosophical inquiry into the problem of the meaning of life. Here is the passage in which Schopenhauer explicitly asked the question: Since a man does not alter, and his moral character remains absolutely the same all through his life; since he must play out the part which he has received, without the least deviation from the character; since neither experience, nor philosophy, nor religion can effect any improvement in him, the question arises, What is the meaning of life at all? (1860 b)  emphasis added  The circumstances under which concern with the problem of the meaning of life were, in Schopenhauer s case, not merely academic but real and personal. Well off financially, but struggling with personal misery and a sense of loneliness and isolation, he felt driven to find some understanding of himself and of the world around him that seemed so bleak and senseless. Schopenhauer s philosophy begins with a metaphysical structure he inherited from Kant and more or less simply decrees. There is a difference between the thing - in - itself and the phenomenal world of appearances. The thing - in - itself is the will to live, or, more simply, the will. It is the fundamental power and reality that underlies all things. The world we know and live in, with its stupendous abundance of things and forms, is merely the phenomena of the will, the objectification of it, its mirror, something not entirely real, or not real at all. (There is also a pure, will - less subject of knowledge whose metaphysical status is unclear: sometimes it seems to be in the very realm of the will, the realm of true reality, of things - in - themselves; at other times it seems to be something like the first creation and objectification of the will.) The will itself just wills. It is pretty nasty, perhaps demonic. It is a blind striving, craving, and grasping, aiming at nothing in the end, except to go on willing and aggrandizing itself. It has in itself an inner contradiction, manifest in the constant struggle and strife between the billions of individual objectifications of itself in the phenomenal world. I am one such objectification; you are another. My true self, my inner essence, is the will; the same is true of you: my essence and yours are one and the same. When we fight (as we usually do), the will is engaged in a battle with itself. The phenomenal world is an awful place. It is full of misery, pain, suffering. Little happiness is found anywhere. The twin poles of human life are pain (want, desire, stress) and boredom. Almost everyone lives a life that, from without, is meaningless and insignificant and, from within, dull and senseless. But what is the meaning of life? The question is appropriate because life as we know it is something like Macbeth s tale told by an idiot, a  farce. If the question is about life s inner essence, Schopenhauer s answer is simply  the will - to - live. The meaning of life is the will. Another way of taking the question  What is the meaning of life?  is to construe it as a question about the goal, point, aim, end, or purpose of life. When Schopenhauer explicitly asks the question (in On Human Nature), it is this sense of it he appears to have in mind. His answer is depressing. The point or purpose of life is to suffer. We are being punished for the crime of being born, punished for who we are, namely, the nasty thoroughly egoistic will. The meaning of life in this sense, then, is to suffer, to be punished for our sin. Schopenhauer suggests a number of ways of thinking about our phenomenal, experienced life. All of them are pretty bleak. He recommends that we look upon our life: as an unprofitable episode interrupting the blessed calm of nothingness; as on the whole a disappointment, nay, a cheat; as Hell, in which on the one hand men are the tormented souls and on the other the tormenting devils; as a place of atonement, a sort of penal colony; as some kind of mistake; and as a process of disillusionment. Any or all of these could be taken as answers to the question  What is the meaning of life?  (or to the question  What is life? ) If we ask what we should do, how we can give our lives worth and meaning, Schopenhauer does have an answer. Salvation  lies in the total denial of the will. Knowledge of the will and its horrific phenomena can and should function as a quieter of the will, bringing it to a state in which it stops willing and effectively abolishes itself. Thinking in this vein, a Schopenhauerian might say that the meaning of life is to deny, quiet, and eventually abolish the will to live that is essentially oneself. One naturally wants to know whether this is not just suicide whether the cessation of willing simply means that one passes into a state of nothingness. Schopenhauer s answer is  No. The state of the will - less individual after death seems to be nothing to us; but our present state would seem to be nothing to him. His state is wonderful and blessed, but what it is like is inconceivable to us. In our current state, when one denies the will in herself, she does not literally commit suicide. Suicide doesn t work because it is itself a powerful act of willing. Instead, she practices self - denial and asceticism, cultivates detachment, stops wanting and pursuing the things most people go for; and although there is still some struggle with the dying will in her, on the whole her life becomes full of peace and joy. The will is quieted and eventually abolishes itself in the individual. Very few people are capable of doing this heroic thing, Schopenhauer says, but he himself does not claim to be one of these people. For all the darkness of his philosophy, the moral for all of us even those of us who are not prepared to totally deny the will which Schopenhauer derives in the end is very much in the Christian Buddhist vein. We should not be competitive or grasping or villainous, but rather we should show compassion and kindness to everyone, since everyone is always having a bad day in this hell we are all living in, and what we all need above all are love, compassion, help, and consideration. The fundamental principle of morality, which you should follow, is: Don t hurt anyone; help everyone you can. Following this principle, one can achieve, short of complete denial of the will, a kind of half - way salvation. Another of Schopenhauer s points about meaning in life should be mentioned. It is that the meaningfulness of one s life depends not on one s outer circumstances but rather on the way one looks at life. People look at life differently, and so the meaningfulness of her life varies considerably from person to person. To one person life is barren, dull, and superficial; to another rich, interesting, and full of meaning. b. Kierkegaard A major nineteenth century European philosopher who continued the tradition of thought on the meaning of life was the Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard (1813 - 1855). Kierkegaard was not an academic. The sources of his interest in problems of meaning seem to have been his not having to work for a living, his personal demons, his Nordic gloom, his congenital tendencies toward guilt, depression, anxiety, and dread, his awareness of increasing doubt all around him of the teachings of his inherited Christianity, and his agonizing failure to live up to his own Christian ideals, primarily because of his embodiment and its concomitant proclivity for the things of the flesh, especially sensuousness and sex. Out of all that emerged what appears to be a severe case of self - loathing, which in turn prompted serious inquiry into the meaning of (his) life. It is difficult to determine what Kierkegaard s own views were on just about everything because he constantly used humor, satire, paradox, and irony, and even more because he spoke in different voices and wrote from different perspectives under different pseudonyms. Nonetheless, the standard view is that Kierkegaard was fundamentally a Christian. He claimed that one s life can be meaningful and worth living only if one believes genuinely and passionately in the Christian God. And then there is the leap. Christian belief goes beyond rational evidence, and even conflicts with it. One must make a leap from knowledge to Christian faith the only thing in which one can find true meaning a leap over the confines of common sense and reason. One is to accept Christian faith even if (or just because?) it is absurd. For it is the only adequate source of the kind of meaning a human being has to have to keep on going with a sense that life is worthwhile. Another way to describe Kierkegaard s overall philosophy is to characterize it in terms of his three stages or levels of life. One should make an ascent from the lowest stage, the aesthetic (sensuous, even sensual), through the higher ethical stage, and on to the highest stage of all, the religious, which somehow baptizes and incorporates the two lower stages into itself. Only one who has reached the religious stage can have a truly meaningful life and thus a life worth living. Whatever Kierkegaard s own view was, we can make the following observations about things Kierkegaard (or one or other of his pseudonymous authors) said about the meaning of life. (1) One thing is that life can seem meaningless. In the early work, Either Or (1843), we find this passage:  How empty and meaningless life is. Elsewhere in Either Or we get similar thoughts and questions, for instance,  What, if anything, is the meaning of this life?  and  My life is utterly meaningless. Perhaps, though, the idea is that, though life is often meaningless, it need not be so, and, when it is, it is because of some kind of failure of the liver (of the life, not the organ). (2) A second interesting idea in Kierkegaard is that meaning has something to do with unity. In a meaningful life all the diverse aspects of it come together to form some kind of coherent whole. One pursues some one goal, to which everything in one s life is subordinated. (3) A third point, an important one, is that, though meaning is a good thing, it is possible for there to be too much meaning in one s life, or in its parts. Kierkegaard observes: No part of life ought to have so much meaning for a person that he cannot forget it any moment he wants to; on the other hand, every single part of life ought to have so much meaning for a person that he can remember it at any moment. (Either Or) To have one s life full of meaning to the brim, to regard life and everything one does in it as infinitely significant, brings with it so much pressure and stress that one s life becomes unbearable. To me  says Kierkegaard  it seems . . . that to be known in time by God makes life enormously strenuous. Everywhere where he is present each half hour is of infinite importance. Yet to live like that for sixty years is unsupportable. It is difficult enough putting up even with the three years  hard study for an examination, and those are still not as strenuous as half an hour like this. (Concluding Unscientific Postscript) (4) A fourth idea about meaning in Kierkegaard is the idea that one can give one s life meaning, or that one can acquire meaning in life, by doing something like devoting oneself to something. Of Antigone he says,  her life acquires meaning for her in its devotion to showing him  her father, after his death  the last honors daily, almost hourly, by her unbroken silence.  (Either Or) (5) Meaning does not come from abstract, objective knowledge of any kind, whether philosophical, or scientific, or historical, or even theological. It comes from some kind of faith, a faith that is passionately acquired and lived daily. (6) One twentieth century approach to the problem of the meaning of life is to see, accept, and bask more or less happily in the absurdity of life. Kierkegaard anticipated this approach prophetically in his characterization of the  humorist. Kierkegaard writes:  Weary of time and its endless succession, the humorist runs away and finds humorous relief in stating the absurd.  (Concluding Unscientific Postscript) (7) Kierkegaard s humorist also at one point expresses a view which is surprisingly rare, namely, the view that one s life may have a meaning, but one doesn t know what it is. Kierkegaard writes:   L et a humorist say what he has in mind and he will speak, for example, as follows: What is the meaning of life? Yes, good question. How should I know?  (Concluding Unscientific Postscript) (8) Although Kierkegaard himself was a Christian who viewed meaning as ultimately grounded in religious faith, in one s personal relation to a supernatural God, yet, paradoxically perhaps, and certainly in an admirable spirit of non - exclusivity, he said: It is possible both to enjoy life and to give it meaning and substance outside Christianity, just as the most famous poets and artists, the most eminent of thinkers, even men of piety, have lived outside Christianity (Concluding Unscientific Postscript). (9) One finds in Kierkegaard the idea that life has meaning only insofar as it is related in some way to the Infinite. Nothing finite can supply the meaning of life. On the whole, if for no other reason, Kierkegaard s work is valuable because of its suggestiveness. Under one pseudonym or another, Kierkegaard made many important points which were taken up, or unfortunately overlooked, by subsequent philosophers concerned with the meaning of life. c. Nietzsche Friedrich Nietzsche (1844 - 1900) cut his philosophical teeth on Schopenhauer and devoted himself in his later works from 1883 up to the onset of insanity in January 1889 to struggle with, among other things, the meaning of life. Nietzsche s grand project was the revaluation of all values. Part of this project was that of giving to life a new meaning. Nietzsche s interest in the matter was not merely academic. Coming up with new values and giving life a new meaning was a project that involved a total transformation of Nietzsche s own self, early versions of which he became dissatisfied with. One thing Nietzsche wanted to do was to produce an affirmative philosophy of life to replace Schopenhauer s pessimistic, life - denying philosophy. Nietzsche rejected Schopenhauer s picture of life as suffering, or punishment for one s sin, together with its ethic of compassion toward the poor and the sick. Such a picture belonged to a weak, sick, decadent, nay - saying mode of being in decline. Nietzsche himself wanted to produce a positive, healthy, life - affirming philosophy, one suitable for life in the ascendant. Sometimes, particularly early in his writings, Nietzsche seemed to think some end or other is required to make things meaningful. At times, both early and late, Nietzsche spoke as though the very concept of the meaning of something is the concept of its end, object, or goal. In other places, however, Nietzsche spoke as if the meaning of life lies in freedom from, not in the achievement of, ends. Perhaps this should be construed as the rejection of given ends to be discovered, not in the rejection of all ends, particularly those one creates. Moritz Schlick whose thought we will consider in more detail later claimed that Nietzsche saw that life has no meaning so long as it stands wholly under the domination of purposes. In Nietzsche s Zarathustra,  Sir Hazard,  expressing Nietzsche s own considered view, says,  I have saved them from the slavery of ends.  (Klemke, 3 rd ed., 63). Nietzsche sometimes spoke as if life, before he came into it, or before he revaluated all values, had no meaning:  Sombre is human life, and as yet without meaning: a buffoon may be fateful to it  (Thus Spake Zarathustra, 1883). There is no meaning  out there  to be discovered, no meaning in the essences of things, apart from human will, desire, perspective. In fact, apart from perspective, there is no world out there at all, no  thing - in - itself,  no  facts - in - themselves. But a psychologically strong person can do without things in themselves and meaning (already there) to be discovered in them. That is because he can organize a small part of the world himself and thus create meaning. In The Will to Power, Nietzsche speaks of  the creative strength to create meaning,  and he says: It is a measure of the degree of strength of will to what extent one can do without meaning in things, to what extent one can endure to live in a meaningless world because one organizes a small portion of it oneself. (The Will to Power) Whatever the meaning of life is, or is to be, it is terrestrial, not celestial. Meaning must not be placed in some fabricated  true world  but in this very earth in which we live and have our being. And the meaning of life is to be created, not discovered. Still, somehow, man is not the meaning and measure of all things, though he has posited himself as such. All the values by means of which we have tried so far to render the world estimable for ourselves and which then proved inapplicable and therefore devaluated the world all these values are, psychologically considered, the results of certain perspectives of utility, designed to maintain and increase human constructs of domination and they have been falsely projected into the essence of things. What we find here is still the hyperbolic naivet  of man: positing himself as the meaning and measure of the value of things. (The Will to Power) The mistake lies in projecting our own values onto reality, in thinking that our meaning and values are present in things as such. But our meaning does not lie in  things - in - themselves. It is created by us. If we then give things out there such and such a meaning, we should recognize that it is not a meaning we have found in the things themselves, but rather one that we have given them. We can still ask, What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning we shall give to life? Nietzsche gives two different answers. One is that the meaning of life is the  bermensch (sometimes translated as  Superman ), Nietzsche s post - human creator of meaning, affirmer of life, and bearer of values. I want to teach men the sense of their existence, which is the Superman, the lightning out of the dark cloud man. (Thus Spake Zarathustra) The Superman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: The Superman SHALL BE the meaning of the earth! (Thus Spake Zarathustra) The other answer is that the meaning of life is the will to power. All meaning is will to power. (The Will to Power) On the surface these two answers are different. But perhaps they are consistent. Perhaps what the will to power generates is the Superman, or what the Superman represents is the will to power. Again, perhaps the will to power is the meaning of life in the sense of its kernel or essence, while the Superman is its meaning in the sense of its end or goal. Nietzsche s view has some aspects or consequences that should be noted. One consequence of Nietzsche s view is that the meaning of life is absent in the old and the sick. He acknowledged the fact. Another consequence (or perhaps component) of Nietzsche s view is that nihilism, the denial of all value, is a transitional stage, not the finale. Yet another consequence is that the meaning of life is not about the predominance of pleasure over pain. Concern with that evidences only nihilism. Finally, it may be conjectured that Nietzsche would probably regard with scorn those of us in the current debate among academic philosophers about the meaning of life. He would consider us  minute  philosophers: The study of the minute philosophers is only interesting for the recognition that they have reached those stages in the great edifice of philosophy where learned disquisitions for and against, where hair - splitting objections and counter - objections are the rule: and for that reason they evade the demand of every great philosophy to speak sub specie aeternitatis. (Nietzsche, 1874) d. Tolstoy One of the next thinkers in the Western intellectual tradition to ask seriously the question,  What is the meaning of life?  was the great Russian novelist and moralist Count Leo Tolstoy (1828 - 1910). He asked the question and offered part of an answer in A Confession, written in Russian in 1879, circulated in 1882, and translated and published in 1884. Tolstoy s reflections on the question stimulated a great deal of subsequent debate on the issue. Although characters in his earlier works, such as War and Peace, sometimes talked about the meaning of life and felt the problem deeply, Tolstoy himself raised serious questions about it only as part of a psychological crisis he underwent in the mid to late 1870 s. Despite having everything anyone could ever want wealth, fame, status, love, physical strength, and so forth Tolstoy found himself severely disturbed. His symptoms were depression, psychological paralysis, obsession with suicide, and the continual recurrence in his head of the question of the meaning of life. Tolstoy put his question about the meaning of life in several different ways. Here are some of them, listed in order of their occurrence in his Confession: What is it for? What does it lead to? Why? What then? What for? But what does it matter to me? What of it? Why go on making any effort? How go on living? What will come of what I am doing today or shall do tomorrow? What will come of my whole life? Why should I live, why wish for anything, or do anything? Is there any meaning in my life that the inevitable death awaiting me does not destroy? What am I, with my desires? Why do I live? What must I do? What is the meaning of my life? Why do I exist? Several of these seem to be quite different questions, but Tolstoy regarded them all as the same question put in different ways. Tolstoy said explicitly that his question was not about the composition, origin, and fate of the universe, nor again about the question,  What is the life of the whole? That question, Tolstoy said, is unanswerable for a single man, and it is  stupidity  to think an individual must first answer the question about the meaning of the universe or the whole of humanity before he can answer the question of the meaning of his own life. Tolstoy came to think that he should not expect to find the answers to his questions in philosophy. The legitimate task of philosophy is merely to ask the question and perhaps refine and clarify it, not to answer it, which it cannot do. This view of philosophy as incapable of providing answers to the questions of life must have been one Tolstoy came to some way into his crisis. At another point, apparently earlier, Tolstoy did try to find answers in philosophy (as well as in the mathematical, physical, biological, and social sciences). The philosophers he studied were Socrates, the Buddha,  Solomon  (the author of Ecclesiastes), and Schopenhauer. All of these he interpreted as providing a negative answer. The gist of Socrates  thought is that the true philosopher seeks death, because the life of the body, with all its ailments and desires, is an impediment to what he is really all about, namely, the quest for truth. The individual life of the physically discrete individual is pretty meaningless, something one would rather do without. The Buddha, as Tolstoy read him, teaches that life is the greatest of evils and works as hard as he can to free himself from it. Solomon  teaches that it s all  vanity. And Schopenhauer, as Tolstoy understood him, wishes for, and advocates, annihilation. In a nutshell, Tolstoy s problem was this: since I will suffer, die, be forgotten, and make no difference (leave no trace) in the long run, how does my life, or anything I do, have any meaning? It was a problem he felt deeply. He had to have an answer to go on living. Tolstoy s concern with the issue was not merely theoretical. The solution to the problem that Tolstoy eventually came to was one he thought had been known all along by the unlearned peasants. The solution lies in a kind of irrational knowledge called  faith. Faith is faith in God, and lived faith involves some kind of relation to the Infinite. Meaning is found in the appropriate relationship to God, the Infinite. Tolstoy s solution bears obvious resemblances to Kierkegaard s and is very much in the same spirit. Tolstoy spent the rest of his life working out the details of, or variations on, this solution. The progress of his thought can be traced in What I Believe and On Life, as well as in his late short fiction (The Death of Ivan Ilych, Father Sergius, and so forth). To the end Tolstoy held that faith in God, work, service to others, unselfishness, and love are essential parts of a meaningful life. He taught that the things ordinarily pursued by many wealth, status, power, fame contribute nothing to the meaningfulness of life. e. Some Common Aspects of the Lives of Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Tolstoy Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Tolstoy all had lives which rendered them virtual breeding grounds for problems with the meaning of life. (1) All of them were well off and did not have to work for a living; there is no evidence that any of them ever felt a real threat of, say, homelessness or starvation. Nietzsche was the one that wasn t exactly wealthy, but in his case his early retirement (in his late twenties) provided him with a pension for life sufficient to meet his material needs and free him up for a life of thought and writing. (2) All of them suffered from psychological illness of one sort or another at the very least, a sense of gloom or melancholy, and in some cases a sense of worthlessness and a preoccupation with suicide, or feelings of dread and anxiety, or the encroachment of outright madness. (3) All of them grew up in religious environments, the tenets of which they lost faith in when they reached adulthood, and the lack of which they struggled with throughout their lives (eventually regaining, in the cases of Kierkegaard and Tolstoy, some portion of what they had lost). (4) None of them was a professional academician, except for Nietzsche in his youth. From these four, and from our own experiences of life, we have inherited, to the extent that we have it, our preoccupation with the meaning of life. 3. Early Twentieth Century Continental Philosophers In the early twentieth century questions about the meaning of life continued to be of interest to leading European or  Continental  philosophers. a. Heidegger The great German philosophy professor Martin Heidegger (1889 - 1976) was certainly concerned with the meaning of life. He presented two different outlooks, which we may call  early Heidegger  and  later Heidegger. For early Heidegger (that is, the Heidegger of Being and Time, 1927), the question of the meaning of life is the question how we can live an  authentic  life, one that is our life, not just the life for us that has been fixed by the community we live in. His answer is that to live a meaningful life is to live a life of authenticity. To live a life authenticity is to live a life that one oneself chooses, not the life that is prescribed for one by one s social situation. To live a life of authenticity, one must have a plan, something that unifies one s life into an organic whole. This is one s own plan. So a meaningful life is one of focused authenticity. Authenticity is Heidegger s accounted of what it is to live a meaningful life. Living authentically, it turns out, is a matter of living in a way that is true to your heritage. Being true to heritage is being true to your own, deepest self. In the end, the content of authenticity is not something you freely choose ex nihilo, but rather something you discover in the conjunction of heritage and facticity. Early Heidegger s thought seems to be a kind of pantheism, and it is possible that Heidegger subscribed to some such view all his life. Later Heidegger proposes a somewhat different view. In this philosophy of his, we are given the task, in which our meaning lies, of being  guardians of the world. The world is a holy place. To understand and appreciate that fact is to exhibit not just a certain intellectual and practical stance toward the world, but to live with an attitude of respect and reverence toward the world, toward the natural world especially. Later Heidegger saw exploitation of the natural world, as in mining and highway - building, as deplorable, as contrary to the very meaning of life. The meaning of life is guardianship of the world. b. Sartre The French philosopher Jean - Paul Sartre (1905 - 1980) changed his views over the course of his life. In his work Being and Nothingness (1943), advocated an outlook from which life is absurd. We more or less seriously pursue goals which, from a detached standpoint, we can see don t really matter. But we continue to act as though they do, and hence our lives are absurd. The Sartrean project is to overcome this detached standpoint, or to incorporate it into our lives. The problem is other people. They insist on their own reality. They tend to get in the way of our pursuit of our own goals. Later on, Sartre espoused a somewhat different view. On this new view,  our fundamental goal in life is to overcome our  contingency ,  to become the foundation of our own being. The main obstacle (again) is other people who, on the one hand, pursue their own (different) goals and, on the other, propose a real (military) threat to one s way of life and one s homeland. In his 1944 play, No Exit, there is the famous line:  Hell is other people. Other people do not cooperate with my projects, and I do not cooperate with theirs. The result is war, in something like Schopenhauer s sense. People are always at war, or at least at odds, with each other. In both his early and his later thought, Sartre ends up being pretty pessimistic and depressing. Life is meaningless. We can, by our free choice, give life some meaning or other. But the decision to do so is itself a matter of ungrounded free choice, which is such that it doesn t matter whether that decision or some other one is made. c. Camus Albert Camus (1913 - 1960), a Frenchman born in Algeria, was one of the leading existentialists (though he himself disowned the label) and one of the more influential writers of the first half of the twentieth century. He was familiar with the work of Nietzsche, and greatly influenced by it. On our theme, Camus s starting point was the perception of the absurd. Human life, he felt, was absurd, meaningless, and senseless. The way in which it is, or the reason it is, lies in an inevitable clash between the needs and aspirations of human beings and the cold, meaningless world. This clash has at least four facets. First, we seek demand, even a rational understanding of things, some way of seeing the world as familiar to us. But the world does not cooperate: to us, it is ultimately unintelligible. Second, we long for some kind of unity underlying and organizing the manifest diversity we find all around us. But again, the world is heedless of our longings. The world that presents itself to our senses is nothing but disjointed plurality. Third, we long for a higher reality (a God, for example), something transcendent, some cosmic meaning of everything. But no such meaning can be discerned. Fourth, we strive for continued life, or at least to achieve something permanent in the end. But our efforts are pointless, everything will come to nothing, and all that lies ahead is death and oblivion. Our situation is like that of the mythical Greek of old, Sisyphus. We are condemned, as it were, to pushing a rock up a hill, over and over only to see it roll back down again, every time, when it reaches the top. Pointless labor is Sisyphus  lot, and ours too. The pointlessness and absurdity of life raise the question of suicide. Should we kill ourselves? Camus s answer is that, no, we should not. Suicide is escapist. To kill yourself is to give in, to lose. If we were prisoners of war which is something like what we are our captor and tormentor would want us to do exactly that confess that things are too much for us and kill ourselves. That would be his ultimate victory, which would bring him a chuckle, or perhaps even a hearty guffaw. How then should we live? The first thing to do is to insist that life is better if there is no meaning. That would really irritate our tormentor. Second, we should cultivate a mindset of honesty and lucidity. We should not indulge in denial, or evasion, or imaginings of an eventual escape into an afterlife where everything will be put right. We should acknowledge that life is awful but then, perhaps, add  and I love it  or  all is well. Third, we should take up an attitude of revolt, defiance, and scorn. Camus observes,  There is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn. Surely such an attitude would vex our hypothetical tormentor beyond measure. Fourth, we should live for now, stop worrying about the future, stop striving to achieve future goals. Nothing is going to come of anything we do in the long run anyway. Fifth, we should  use everything up : work hard, play hard, approach everything with zest and passion, expend energy to the human limit. This amounts to a kind of perverse  Yes!  to life. Finally, we may ask why anyone would want to live like this? Is it something that would appeal only to the French? What are the advantages of such an attitude toward life? Camus has answers to these queries, three in fact. First, living as he recommends is a way of salvaging our dignity, and it is a way to which a certain majesty adheres. Second, surprisingly perhaps, such a way of living brings with it a  curious joy. Third, it is the way of freedom. Camus s scornful existentialism is the best conception we have of a truly free human being, one who does not allow himself to be shaped and determined by the mindless, meaningless world that surrounds him. 4. Early Twentieth Century Analytic, American, and English - Language Philosophers Anglo - American philosophers in the very late eighteenth and early twentieth centuries continued to be interested in problems of the meaning of life as well. a. James The American pragmatist philosopher William James (1842 - 1910), a Harvard professor, wrote a couple of interesting essays on our theme in the late 1890 s. Both essays were written as addresses to be delivered to live audiences. They demand some discussion and consideration. In  Is Life Worth Living?  (1895), James reveals deep, probably first - person, familiarity, with the existential source of concern with the issues of the meaning and worthwhileness of life. He calls it the  profounder bass - note of life  and suggests that it is to be found, or heard, somewhere in all of us:  In the deepest heart of all of us there is a corner in which the ultimate mystery of things works sadly.  (1895: 32) Some people are so naturally optimistic and in love with life that they are constitutionally incapable of being much bothered by the bass - note and pay it little attention. James s example of such a person is Walt Whitman; and one thinks of the English. James finds no fault intellectual, moral, or otherwise with such people. It is rare good fortune to be blessed with such a temperament. If everyone were, the question of the worthwhileness of life would never arise. But for every Whitman, there is a suicide, and a thinker of the dreary constitution of the poet James Thomson, author of  The City of Dreadful Night. In his address, James imagines himself in discussion with a would - be suicide whom he tries to persuade to take up his burden and see life through to its natural end. James acknowledges that some of these suicides perhaps the majority of them are too far gone to have anything said to them, for instance, those whose suicidal impulses are due to insanity or sudden fits of frenzy. It is to the class of reflective would - be suicides those disposed to kill themselves because of their thinking, reading, and brooding on the darker side of life that James directs his remarks. It is these he wants to cheer up (or comfort) and keep alive. James speaks of two stages of recovery from suicidal illness. The first stage includes three elements, three palliatives, for the suicidal condition. First, there is the thought,  You can end it whenever you will. This strikes one as a strange thought to recommend to one contemplating suicide. But James thinks the thought can be a comfort. It means there s no particular guilt or stigma attached to suicide. It means one won t have to put up with this miserable world forever; one can opt out whenever one wants. It may delay the act by encouraging the thought,  Why kill myself today when I can always do it tomorrow? Second, James points out, there is in human beings a natural sense of curiosity. It is worth hanging around a while longer in order to see the headlines of tomorrow s newspaper. Third, there is a certain fighting instinct in human beings. James thinks the normal man has a reason to go on, even if the whole thing is worthless and meaningless, as long as there is some injustice to be put right, some villain to be put down, or some evil to overcome in the little corner of the universe he inhabits. The three things just mentioned all lie in the first stage of recovery, one that is partial and inferior to what lies in the second stage. The second stage is one of full recovery. It is the religious stage. It gives one assurance of a fully worthwhile and meaningful life. James s injunction is to believe to believe in a supernatural, spiritual order of things which overcomes and makes right the deficiencies of the natural order as we know it. We do not have rational or evidential proof that such a supernatural order exists. But Kant proved that natural science cannot prove that such an order does not exist. To make one s life worthwhile and meaningful, all one has to do is to posit faith in such an order, to believe that there is a spiritual realm in which all the wrongs of the natural order are righted. In that case, one will view the natural order as an inadequate representation of the spiritual, or as a veil through which the true and wonderful nature of the spiritual is hidden or obscured. One need have little conception of what the spiritual realm is like. The content of the belief in it can be quite minimal. All one needs to affirm is that there is such a realm and that its reality makes life worthwhile. James draws on two of the tenets of his pragmatism to support such an approach to the meaning and worthwhileness of life. One is the right to believe what we need to believe, even though it goes beyond belief warranted by empirical and rational evidence. His classic case for the right of such belief is in his essay,  The Will to Believe. Another tenet of pragmatism on which James draws is the idea that belief is a matter of action. To believe something is not so much to have a certain mental state as to act in a certain way. Whatever is in one s mind, to act as though life is worthwhile and has meaning is to believe that it does In  What Makes a Life Significant  (1899), James expressly addressed the question of the significance or meaning of life. What he said in this essay was rather different from what he had said in the previous one. The essay was in part a response to the deification of the uneducated, hard - working peasants in Tolstoy s Confession. James admired Tolstoy a great deal but felt he went a bit overboard in his praise of peasant life and in his tendency to identify it as the very locus of meaning. James held that the lives of Tolstoy s peasants were full of one ingredient necessary for a meaningful life toil, struggle, pluck, will, suffering, manly virtues but that they lacked the other necessary ingredient for a fully meaningful life, namely, what James called  ideals. Toward the end of the essay, James gives his own view. He states it in two or three different ways, the sense of which seems to be the same. I deal visions  must be backed  with what the laborers have, the sterner stuff of manly virtue. T o redeem life from insignificance,  c ulture and refinement all alone are not enough. . . . Ideal aspirations are not enough, when uncombined with pluck and will. . . . There must be some sort of fusion, some chemical combination among these principles, for a life objectively and thoroughly significant to result. (1899: 877) The solid meaning of life is always the same eternal thing, the marriage, namely, of some unhabitual ideal, however special, with some fidelity, courage, and endurance; with some man s or woman s pains. And, whatever or wherever life may be, there will always be the chance for that marriage to take place. (1899: 878) James is rather vague about what the  ideals  are, or even what they are like. In at least some cases they have something to do with culture and refinement, but it seems that they can and will vary from person to person, and may reside in some form in the uncultured and unrefined. In any event, it is noteworthy that James does not bring up the subject of religion. There is no suggestion that belief in God or a spiritual world is necessary for a fully meaningful life. An ideal wedded to manly virtue is enough. b. Russell The British philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872 - 1970) is often portrayed as one of those early twentieth century analytic philosophers who had no patience for big questions, such as that of the meaning of life. The portrayal is often reinforced by the famous story of Russell and the cab - driver, to whom Russell had nothing to say about the meaning of life. It is true that Russell sometimes expressed a dismissive attitude toward the question: to Hugh Moorhead he said,  Unless you assume a God, the question (of life s meaning) is meaningless  (Metz 2013 b: 23), and to the taxi - driver he had indeed nothing to say about the meaning of life. But elsewhere he seems to have taken the question very seriously. In  A Free Man s Worship,  he begins with a fairly gloomy, despairing picture of the world science reveals to us, the only world there is, really. It is purposeless, void of meaning. The causes that produced us had no prevision of the end they were achieving. We ourselves, and everything precious to us, are the outcome of the accidental collocations of atoms. There is no life for the individual beyond the grave. The existence of our very species, along with all its achievements, will eventually be extinguished in the death of the solar system and  buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins. But the thing for us to do is to maintain our ideals against the hostile universe. That universe knows the value of raw power, and not much else. Let us not worship it, as did Nietzsche. In exalting the will to power, Nietzsche was failing to maintain the highest human ideals in the face of the cruel world; he was, in a sense, giving in, capitulating, prostrately submitting to evil, sacrificing his best to Moloch. Let us be clear - sighted and honest. Let us recognize that the facts are often bad, that in the world we know there are many things that would have been better otherwise, that our ideals are not in fact realized in the world. But, again, in our minds and hearts, even though the whole business may be futile, let us tenaciously cling to our ideals, loving truth and beauty. Let us renounce power. Let us worship only the God created by our own love of the good. Let us live constantly in the vision of the good. One trap we must guard against falling into is that which (Russell would think) Camus fell into some decades later. We should not cultivate and live in a spirit of fiery revolt, of fierce hatred of the senseless universe. Why not? Because indignation is still a kind of bondage, for it compels our thoughts to be occupied with the evil world. Give up the indignation so that your thoughts can be free. From freedom of thought comes art, philosophy, and the vision of beauty. To achieve this we must develop a kind of detachment from our own personal happiness, must learn to free ourselves from the burden of concern for petty things and personal goods. To abandon the struggle for private happiness, to expel all eagerness of temporary desire, to burn with passion for eternal things this is emancipation, and this is the free man s worship. (Russell 1903: 61) In The Conquest of Happiness Russell makes a couple of remarks about the meaning of life that are worthy of note. The first is this: The habit of looking to the future and thinking that the whole meaning of the present lies in what it will bring forth is a pernicious one. There can be no value in the whole unless there is value in the parts. Life is not to be conceived on the analogy of a melodrama in which the hero and heroine go through incredible misfortunes for which they are compensated by a happy ending. (1930: 29) The second is odd but interesting, perhaps not the kind of thought that would occur to most people: the human heart as modern civilisation has made it is more prone to hatred than to friendship. And it is prone to hatred because it is dissatisfied, because it feels deeply, perhaps even unconsciously, that it has somehow missed the meaning of life, that perhaps others, but not we ourselves, have secured the good things which nature offers man s enjoyment. (1930: 75) The thought seems to be that people hate each other because they think others have achieved (or know?) the meaning of life and they don t. If that is true, one should be careful not to let on that he knows the meaning of life, even if he does. Several writers have advocated focus and have thought of a life organized by one big project or goal as the paradigm case of a meaningful one. Russell rejects the idea. All our affections are at the mercy of death, which may strike down those whom we love at any moment. It is therefore necessary that our lives should not have that narrow intensity which puts the whole meaning and purpose of our life at the mercy of accident. For all these reasons the man who pursues happiness wisely will aim at the possession of a number of subsidiary interests in addition to those central ones upon which his life is built. (1930: 177) Finally, in  The Place of Science in a Liberal Education,  Russell makes the now familiar point that the meaning of life must come not from without but from within. The search for an outside meaning that can compel an inner response must always be disappointed: all  meaning  must be at bottom related to our primary desires, and when they are extinct no miracle can restore to the world the value which they reflected upon it. (Mysticism and Logic, ch. 2,  The Place of Science in a Liberal Education ) That is not to say that the meaning of life is created or chosen as opposed to discovered. For our primary desires are something largely given, something (if we are lucky) we simply find in ourselves. c. Schlick Moritz Schlick (1882 - 1936) was one of the central figures of the logical positivist movement. Thinkers in the movement are commonly said to have been dismissive of such  metaphysical  questions as that of the meaning of life. Yet Schlick for one was in no way dismissive. He described himself as a seeker of the meaning of life and wrote an extremely interesting essay on the topic in 1927. Schlick s contribution to the debate is (to some) one of the most appealing writings in the whole of the literature. Schlick was aware of Schopenhauer s musings and was concerned to escape his dire conclusions. Schlick found his answer in (his interpretation of) Nietzsche s Thus Spake Zarathustra. The answer is that life can be meaningful only if it is freed from its subjugation to ends and purposes. The suggestion is radical: a life has meaning only if it does not have some end or purpose to which everything is subordinated. Schlick argued that the meaning of life is to be found not in work but in play. Work, in the philosophical sense, is always something done not for its own sake but for the sake of something else, some end or purpose that is to be achieved. Most often that end is the survival and perpetuation of life that is, more work functioning only to perpetuate the life of the species. But it is absurd to take the meaning of life to lie in the continued survival of the species, or in the work required to make that survival possible. The meaning of life must lie in the content of existence, not in bare existence as such. What then is the meaning of life? One candidate that suggests itself is feelings of pleasure and happiness. But Schlick rejects that candidate, partly on the grounds that pleasure is likely only to lead to the satiety and boredom which Schopenhauer so vividly made us aware of. Schlick also rejects the ideal of happiness as the meaning of life by way of the observation that man is essentially an active creature for which a life of idle pleasure is by no means suitable. What Schlick ends up saying is that the meaning of life is to be found in play, that is, in activity engaged in for its own glorious sake and not for the furtherance of some further end or goal. Doing something only in order to produce some further end or goal is work, and work cannot be the meaning of life. Of course, work is necessary for human existence and thriving, but it is meaningful only if it can and it can be turned into play, something one would do with delight even if nothing came of it in the end. Schlick backs off from saying that the meaning of life is play. Instead, he says that the meaning of life is youth, since youth is the period of life in which play predominates. A nice consequence of this position is the fact that a life cut short in its infancy or youth is a meaningful life. If you are killed when you are ten years old, it is likely that you lived a life full of meaning. One other aspect of Schlick s view should be mentioned. It is that youth is not literally a matter of how long one has lived on this earth. If an old fellow turns his work into play, if he performs it primarily for the sake of the sheer joy of doing it, then he is young in the sense that matters. The key to a fully meaningful life would be to stay forever young. d. Tagore The Bengali Indian poet, short - story writer, novelist, dramatist, artist, sage, and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore (1861 - 1941), often credited with a major role in the cross - fertilization of East and West, won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1919. He wrote in English (sometimes). He knew the works of Einstein, Yeats, Wordsworth, and a host of other Western thinkers. In 1930 he delivered the Hibbert Lectures at Oxford, published the next year as The Religion of Man (1931), a remarkable volume containing much reflection on the meaning of life. This article will limit itself to consideration of a couple of points in that book. Tagore is interesting because his interest in the question of the meaning of life did not arise out of anything like the circumstances which seemed to create the interest in so many Western thinkers. Tagore was not well - off and bored, he did not suffer from depression and existential angst, he did not worry about the importance of his personal life in the vast scheme of things, he was not a professional academic philosopher. Tagore s tendency was to view the question of the meaning of life as the question,  What is man?  or  What am I? His answer seems to have been that the true human is the universal self, or the true Man represented by the life of the species, or even by the life of all beings. If he had a problem, it lay in the chaotic, hodgepodge nature of this everyday life. Not exactly seeking for a solution to the predicament, one came to him on an ordinary day on which he was just living his everyday life in east India. He gives a gripping and poetic account of it in chapter six of The Religion of Man. He writes: Suddenly I became conscious of a stirring of soul within me. My world of experience in a moment seemed to become lighted, and the facts that were detached and dim found a great unity of meaning. The feeling which I had was like that which a man, groping through a fog without knowing his destination, might fee when he suddenly discovers that he stands before his own house. (Tagore 1931, 95) One thing that is noteworthy in this is that Tagore felt he had seen the meaning of life, not when he realized that his life really mattered, or added up to something sub specie aeternitatus, nor when he came up with a view of things that rid him of his angst and depression, but rather when he found that his life was part of a great unity of meaning. He saw meaning when everything, including his individual life, was one unified whole. A second feature of Tagore s conception of the meaning of life is the role he gives to detachment. The detachment that is relevant seems to be something like non - attachment to the petty concerns of one s own individual life. It is not a lack of concern for anything and everything. It is lack of concern for how one s own individual, personal life fares. The appropriately detached person places his interest in how Man as the eternal being, or beings of any sort ultimately fare. (There is an admirable concern for all life, not just human life in the thought of Tagore.) The appropriately detached man loses concern for his personal triumphs and failures and cultivates an enlivening interest in the life of the whole, with which, instead of his personal life, he identifies himself. The result is a vast increase in the sense of meaningfulness in his own life. e. Ayer A very different approach to the problem of the meaning of life was taken by the prominent logical positivist English philosopher A. J. Ayer (1910 - 1989). Ayer argued, in an important 1947 paper, that  there is no sense in asking what is the ultimate purpose of our existence, or what is the real meaning of life  (Ayer 1947: 201). His argument is that there is no reason to believe in anything like a God who created us and intended us for a specific purpose. And even if there were such a God, his purposes could not give life meaning unless we agreed with them and accepted them. Thus the meaning of life always comes back to what we as individuals purpose, value, and aim at. There is no meaning out there to be discovered. Ayer insists that the meaninglessness of life is nothing to cry about. One s life has whatever meaning one gives it. It just doesn t make sense to ask about the meaning of life because there is not, and could not be, such a thing. The question  What is the meaning of life?  is illogical and unanswerable. But a person can give his life a meaning, and if he does, it will be meaningful to him. It will come down to the value judgments the person makes. And these are a matter of personal choice and preference. There is no sense in saying that one person s value judgments are true and another s false. Give your life a meaning, and that s the meaning it will have. 5. Conclusion The dismissal of the question about the meaning of life which was characteristic of Ayer and his generation, and Camus s idea that meaninglessness doesn t matter, may be what ironically sparked the recent interest in the question. The natural philosophical response is that surely the question of the meaning of life is meaningful and important: in light of the remarks of Ayer, Camus, and their ilk, how is that so? A sense that the meaning of life must be a philosophical problem that matters has motivated work on the question of what the question of the meaning of life is all about, if we do not take Ayer s dismissive attitude and Camus s stance toward it. The work of Richard Taylor, Robert Nozick, Thomas Nagel, Joel Feinberg, Harry Frankfurt, Susan Wolf, Thaddeus Metz, Joshua Seachris, Julian Young, John Cottingham, David Benatar, and Garrett Thomson (among others) are attempts to answer this question. The preceding survey brings us up to around 1950, just before a veritable explosion of works on the meaning of life took place in philosophy, especially in the Anglo - analytic tradition. Those interested in this explosion should begin by consulting the excellent overviews in Thaddeus Metz s article in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Metz 2013) and Joshua Seachris s article in The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Seachris 2012). 6.

Although the most popular voices of this movement were French, most notably Jean - Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, as well as compatriots such as Albert Camus, Gabriel Marcel, and Maurice Merleau - Ponty, the conceptual groundwork of the movement was laid much earlier in the nineteenth century by pioneers like S ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche and twentieth - century German philosophers like Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and Karl Jaspers as well as prominent Spanish intellectuals Jos  Ortega y Gasset and Miguel de Unamuno. The core ideas have also been illuminated in key literary works. Beyond the plays, short stories, and novels by French luminaries like Sartre, Beauvoir, and Camus, there were Parisian writers such as Jean Genet and Andr  Gide, the Russian novelists Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky, the work of Norwegian authors such as Henrik Ibsen and Knut Hamsun, and the German - language iconoclasts Franz Kafka and Rainer Maria Rilke. The movement even found expression across the pond in the work of the  lost generation  of American writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, mid - century  beat  authors like Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsburg, and William S. Burroughs, and the self - proclaimed  American existentialist,  Norman Mailer (Cotkin 2003, 185). What distinguishes existentialism from other movements in the intellectual history of the West is how it stretched far beyond the literary and academic worlds. Its ideas are captured in films by Ingmar Bergman, Michelangelo Antonioni, Jean - Luc Godard, Akira Kurosawa, and Terrence Malick. Its moods are expressed in the paintings of Edvard Munch, Marcel Duchamp, Pablo Picasso, Paul C zanne, and Edward Hopper and in the vitiated forms of the sculptor Alberto Giocometti. Its emphasis on freedom and the struggle for self - creation informed the radical and emancipatory politics of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X as well as the writings of Black intellectuals such as Ralph Ellison, Richard Wright, and W. E. B. Du Bois. Its engagement with the relationship between faith and freedom and the incomprehensibility of God shaped theological debates through the lectures and writings of Karl Barth, Paul Tillich, and Martin Buber, among others. And, with its penetrating analyses of anxiety and the importance of self - realization, the movement has had a profound impact in the development of humanistic and existential approaches to psychotherapy in the work of a wide range of theorists, including R. D. Laing, Rollo May, Viktor Frankl, and Irvin Yalom. With this broad and diverse range of incarnations, it is difficult to explain what the term  existentialism  refers to. The word, first introduced by Marcel in 1943, is certainly not a reference to a coherent system or philosophical school. 1  Indeed, the major contributors are anything but systematic and have widely divergent views, and of these, only Sartre and Beauvoir explicitly self - identified as  existentialists. In surveying its representative thinkers, one finds secular and religious existentialists, philosophers who embrace a conception of radical freedom and others who reject it. And there are those who regard our relations with others as largely mired in conflict and self - deception and others who recognize a deep capacity for self - less love and interdependence. Given these disparate threads and the fact that there is no unifying doctrine, one can nonetheless distill a set of overlapping ideas that bind the movement together. Nihilism: The emergence of existentialism as an intellectual movement was influenced by the rise of nihilism in late nineteenth century Europe as the pre - modern religious worldview was replaced with one that was increasingly secular and scientific. This historical transition resulted in the loss of a transcendent moral framework and contributed to the rise of modernity s signature experiences: anxiety, alienation, boredom, and meaninglessness. Engagement vs. Detachment: Against a philosophical tradition that privileges the standpoint of theoretical detachment and objectivity, existentialism generally begins in medias res, amidst our own situated, first - person experience. The human condition is revealed through an examination of the ways we concretely engage with the world in our everyday lives and struggle to make sense of and give meaning to our existence. Existence Precedes Essence: Existentialists forward a novel conception of the self not as a substance or thing with some pre - given nature (or  essence ) but as a situated activity or way of being whereby we are always in the process of making or creating who we are as our life unfolds. This means our essence is not given in advance; we are contingently thrown into existence and are burdened with the task of creating ourselves through our choices and actions. Freedom: Existentialists agree that what distinguishes our existence from that of other beings is that we are self - conscious and exist for ourselves, which means we are free and responsible for who we are and what we do. This does not mean we are wholly undetermined but, rather, that we are always beyond or more than ourselves because of our capacity to interpret and give meaning to whatever limits or determines us. Authenticity: Existentialists are critical of our ingrained tendency to conform to the norms and expectations of the public world because it prevents us from being authentic or true to ourselves. An authentic life is one that is willing to break with tradition and social convention and courageously affirm the freedom and contingency of our condition. It is generally understood to refer to a life lived with a sense of urgency and commitment based on the meaning - giving projects that matter to each of us as individuals. Ethics: Although they reject the idea of moral absolutes and universalizing judgments about right conduct, existentialism should not be dismissed for promoting moral nihilism. For the existentialist, a moral or praiseworthy life is possible. It is one where we acknowledge and own up to our freedom, take full responsibility for our choices, and act in such a way as to help others realize their freedom.

Nihilism and the Crisis of Modernity We can find early glimpses of what might be called the  existential attitude  (Solomon 2005) in the Stoic and Epicurean philosophies of antiquity, in the struggle with sin and desire in St. Augustine s Confessions, in the intimate reflections on death and the meaning of life in Michel de Montaigne s Essays, and in the confrontation with the  dreadful silence  of the cosmos in Blaise Pascal s Pens es. But it was not until the nineteenth century that the ideas began to coalesce into a bona fide intellectual movement. By this time, an increasingly secular and scientific worldview was emerging and the traditional religious framework that gave pre - modern life a sense of moral orientation and cohesion was beginning to collapse. Without a north star of moral absolutes to guide us, the modern subject was left abandoned and lost,  wandering,  as Nietzsche writes,  as if through an endless nothing  (1887  1974 ,  125). But it wasn t just the rise of modern science and its cold mechanistic view of the world as a value - less aggregate of objects in causal interaction that contributed to the anxiety and forlornness of the modern age. The rise of Protestantism also played a role. With its rejection of hierarchical Church authority, this new form of Christianity emphasized subjective inwardness and created a unique social configuration grounded in principles of individualism, freedom, and self - reliance. The result was the loss of a sense of community and belongingness rooted in the close - knit social bonds of traditional society. And the Protestant shift intensified the Christian attitude of contemptus mundi ( contempt for the world ), contributing to feelings of loneliness and creating a perception of public life as a domain that was fundamentally inauthentic and corrupt (Aho 2020; Guignon 2004; Taylor 1989). Along with these historical developments, social transformations associated with the Industrial Revolution and the formation of the modern state were emerging. With newly mechanized working conditions and bureaucratic forms of administration, an increasingly impersonal and alienating social order was established. When Ortega y Gasset introduces his notion of  the mass man,  he captures the automation and lifeless conformism of the machine age, where everybody  feels just like everybody else and is nevertheless not concerned about it  (1930  1993, 15 ). In their conceptions of  the public  (Kierkegaard),  the herd  (Nietzsche), and  the They  (Heidegger), existentialists offer powerful critiques of the leveled down and routinized ways of being that characterize mass society. And the novels and short stories of Dostoevsky, Camus, and Kafka capture the bourgeois emptiness and boredom of the managerial class and the paranoia and distrust that emerges when life is regulated and controlled by faceless bureaucrats. These social transformations created the conditions for nihilism, where modern humanity suddenly found itself adrift and confused, unsure of which path to take or where to look for a stable and enduring sense of truth and meaning. The condition of nihilism involves the shocking recognition that there is no overarching reason, order, or purpose to our existence, that it is all fundamentally meaningless and absurd. Of all the existentialists, Nietzsche was the most influential and prophetic in diagnosing and conceptualizing the crisis. With the death of God and the loss of moral absolutes, we are exposed to existence  in its most terrible form   without meaning or aim  (Nietzsche 1887  1974 ,  55). And it is against this anomic background that the question of existence, of what it means to be, becomes so urgent. But it is a question that requires taking a radically different standpoint than the one privileged by the philosophical tradition. 2. Engagement vs. Detachment From Plato onward, Western philosophy has generally prioritized a methodology grounded in a perspective of rational detachment and objectivity to arrive at truths that are immutable and timeless. By practicing what Merleau - Ponty disparagingly calls,  high - altitude thinking  (1964  1968 , 73), the philosopher adopts a perspective that is detached and impersonal, a  God s eye view  or  view from nowhere  uncorrupted by the contingencies of our emotions, our embodiment, or the prejudices of our time and place. In this way the philosopher can grasp the  reality  behind the flux of  appearances,  the essential and timeless nature of things  under the perspective of eternity  (sub specie aeternitatis). Existentialism offers a thoroughgoing rejection of this view, arguing that we cannot look down on the human condition from a detached, third - person perspective because we are already thrown into the self - interpreting event or activity of existing, an activity that is always embodied, felt, and historically situated. Existence, then, is generally grasped not just through dispassionate theorizing but through a careful analysis of first - person experience, of the concrete, flesh and blood particulars of everyday life and the feelings, relationships, and commitments that make us who we are. It is a philosophy that begins from the standpoint of the engag , of the individual who is engaged in life and who confronts the givens of existence. 2.1 Subjective Truth The existentialist critique of theoretical detachment was pioneered by Kierkegaard whose scorn was directed primarily at G. W. F. Hegel, a philosopher who adopted the  perspective of eternity  to build a metaphysical system that would provide complete knowledge of reality. By taking a disengaged and panoptic view, Kierkegaard argues Hegel s system invariably covers over the deeply personal project of being human and the specific needs and concerns of the existing individual. In his words,  it makes the subject accidental, and thereby transforms existence into something indifferent, something vanishing  (1846  1941, 173 ). In response, Kierkegaard reverses the traditional orientation that privileges objectivity by claiming that, when it comes to the question of existence, one s own subjective truth is  the highest truth attainable  (1846  1941, 182 ). This means the abstract truths of philosophical detachment are always subordinate to the concrete truths of the existing individual. The real subject,  writes Kierkegaard,  is not the cognitive subject   the real subject is the ethically existing subject  (1846  1941, 281 ). And subjective truth cannot be reasoned about or explained logically; it emerges out of the situated commitments, affects, and needs of the individual. For this reason, it does not disclose timeless and objective truths; it discloses  a truth which is true for me  (1835  1959, 44 ). For Kierkegaard, to live this truth invariably results in feelings of anxiety and confusion because it is objectively uncertain; it has no rational justification, and no one else can understand or relate to it. It is an ineffable truth that is felt rather than known. In this sense, the existing individual  discovers something that thought cannot think  (Kierkegaard 1844  1936, 29 ). But prioritizing the contingent and unrationalizable truths of existence does not mean Kierkegaard is forwarding a position of  irrationalism. He is claiming, rather, that the standpoint of rational detachment cannot help us access the self - defining commitments and projects that matter to the existing individual. Truths of flesh and blood cannot be reduced to systematic explanation because such truths do not provide us with objective knowledge. Rather, they lay bare the passionate and urgent sense of how we should live our lives. They tell the individual:  what I am to do, not what I am to know  (Kierkegaard, 1835  1959, 44 ). 2.2 Perspectivism Nietzsche echoes Kierkegaard s misgivings about methodological detachment and philosophical systems but he does so by forwarding a pragmatic and perspectival account of truth. He argues that philosophers don t discover objective truths by means of detached reasoning because truth claims are always shaped by and embedded in specific sociohistorical contexts. Truths, for Nietzsche, are best understood as social constructs; they are created or invented by a historical people, and they endure only so long as they are socially useful. On Nietzsche s account, truths are passed down historically for generations to the point where they are uncritically accepted as  facts. But from the standpoint of perspectivism,  facts are precisely what there is not,  there are  only interpretations. The world  has no meaning behind it, but countless meanings  (Nietzsche 1901  1968 ,  481). Nietzsche s genealogy is one that shows how the history of Western philosophy is largely a history of forgetting how truths are invented. It is only by means of forgetfulness,  he writes,  that man can ever reach the point of fancying himself to possess a  truth   (Nietzsche 1889 a  1990 a ,  93). This means human beings are already bound up in socially constructed perspectives that they cannot disengage or detach from. To exist, then, is to live in one s  own perspectival forms, and only in them. We cannot see around our own corner  (Nietzsche 1887  1974 ,  374). There is no aperspectival  reality. The epistemological distinction between  appearance  and  reality  is a pseudo - problem that is always parasitic on the perspectival forms that we inhabit. Nietzsche goes on to suggest there is a psychological motivation in our shared belief in objective truth. It shelters us from the terrifying contingency and mutability of existence. Nietzsche understands that human beings are vulnerable and frightened creatures, and the belief in truth even though it is an illusion has social and pragmatic utility by providing a measure of coherence and reliability. We need these truths for psychological protection, to help us cope with an otherwise chaotic and precarious existence. Truth,  therefore,  is that sort of error without which a certain species of life could not live  (Nietzsche 1901  1968 ,  493). 2.3 Being - in - the - World In Being and Time, Heidegger will expand on this critique of detachment and objectivity by developing his own phenomenological analysis of existence or  being - in - the - world  (In - der - Welt - sein). Following the core maxim of phenomenology introduced by his teacher Husserl, Heidegger s philosophy attempts to return  to the things themselves,  to not explain but describe how things are given, reveal themselves, and make sense to us in our average everyday lives. Employing the word  Dasein,  a colloquial German term that refers to the kind of  existence  or  being  unique to humans, Heidegger makes it clear he is not interested in a systematic explanation of what we are, as if existence referred to the objective presence of a substance e.g., a rational animal, an ego cogito, or an ensouled body. As a phenomenologist, he is concerned with how we are. In his version of phenomenology, Dasein is viewed not as a substance with what - like characteristics but as a self - interpreting, meaning - giving activity. Dasein refers to  the subject s way of being  (Heidegger 1927  1982, 123 ), someone who is always already involved and engaged with the equipment, institutions, and practices of a shared world and that embodies a tacit understanding of how to be in that world. Heidegger s conception of being - in - the - world articulates three related ideas that will become central to twentieth - century existentialism and phenomenology. First, it offers a thoroughgoing rejection of the Cartesian view of the self or  I  as a discrete mental container of  inner  thoughts and beliefs that is somehow separate and distinct from  outer  objects in the world. There is no inner - outer dualism because the self is not a disembodied mind or consciousness. It is the activity of existing, a relational activity that is structurally bound up in the world. Thus,  self and world belong together in the single entity, the Dasein  (Heidegger 1927  1982, 297 ). Second, Heidegger compels us to rethink what we mean by  world. From a phenomenological perspective, the world is not a geometrical space nor is it the sum of objects. It is the relational setting of our lives, the shared context of meaning that we are already involved in. And our involvement in the world allows objects to count and matter to us in particular ways. Third, Heidegger suggests that being - in - the - world is a meaning - giving activity. When we engage with and handle objects in the world, we give them meaning; we encounter them as meaningful. What appears to us in the immediacy of lived experience is always shaped by the public meanings we grow into. The fact that our existence is  fraught with meaning  suggests that experience has an intentional structure; it is always directed towards objects; it is about or of something (Heidegger 1919  2002, 60 ). The experience of hearing, for example, is not a representation of bare sense data because sounds are invariably colored by the context of meaning we are thrown into. We hear some - thing: we hear  the thunder of the heavens, the rustling of the woods, the rumbling of the motors, the noises of the city  (Heidegger 1950  1971, 65 , emphasis added). Meaning, on this view, is not generated by detached cognitive associations. It emerges against the background of our functional involvement in the world, in the way we are situated and engaged in a shared network of equipment, roles, institutions, and projects. And this engagement reveals a kind of pre - reflective competence or practical  know how  (k nnen) that can never be made theoretically explicit. 2.4 Embodiment We see, then, that in their critique of third - person detachment existentialists forward the idea that we are already  caught up in the world  (Merleau - Ponty 1945  1962, 5 ). And an essential aspect of being caught up in this way is the experience of one s own embodiment and the crucial role that bodily orientation, affectivity, perception, and motility play in our everyday being - in - the - world. In this way, philosophers such as Merleau - Ponty, Sartre, Beauvoir, and Marcel challenge the traditional interpretation of the body. Against the standard  Cartesian account,  the body is not regarded as a discrete, causally determined object, extended in space, and set apart from the disinterested gaze of the cognizing mind. The body is not something I have. It is a site of affectivity and meaning. It is who I am. And I cannot obtain objective knowledge of my body because I am already living through it; it is the experiential medium of my existence. The body,  as Sartre puts it,  is lived and not known.  (1943  1956, 427 ) 2  By building on the analysis of the lived body (corps propre, corps v cu, corps vivant, Leib), existentialists reveal how our moods, perceptions, and experiences are already bound up in worldly meanings, how we internalize these meanings, and how this act of internalization shapes the way we live, how we handle the tools of daily life, maneuver through lived space, relate to others, and interpret and perform our identities. In her pathbreaking work The Second Sex, Beauvoir illuminates this point by showing how a woman tends to internalize the dominant androcentric worldview, resulting in a representation of herself as subordinate, weak, and inferior. She is the  second sex  not because she is born with a particular biological body, but because she inhabits, enacts, and embodies the oppressive meanings and practices unique to her patriarchal situation. As Beauvoir famously puts it, the woman  is not born, but rather becomes a woman. This is because  the body is not a thing; it is a situation  subject to taboos  and  laws  It is a reference to certain values from which  she  evaluates  herself   (1949  1952, 34, 36 ). The existentialist s distinction between the object - body and the lived - body has made it possible for contemporary philosophers and social theorists to engage the lived experience of those who have been historically marginalized by the western tradition. By rejecting the standpoint of theoretical detachment and focusing on the structures of embodiment and being - in - the - world, influential thinkers such as Franz Fanon (1952  1967 ), Iris Marion Young (1984  2000 ), and Judith Butler (1990), among others, have explored different ways in which we enact and embody forms of oppression and how this can shape our self - image and inhibit the experience of movement, spatial orientation, and other forms of bodily comportment. These investigations help to broaden and pluralize our understanding of the human condition by shedding light on a diverse range of embodied perspectives, from ethnicity and race, sex and gender, and age and physical ability. And insofar as these analyses help capture what is distinct about the meaning - giving activity of humans, they illuminate what is arguably the unifying principle of existentialism:  existence precedes essence.  3. Existence Precedes Essence This principle was initially introduced early on in Heidegger s Being and Time when he writes,  The  essence  of Dasein lies in its existence  (1927  1962, 42 ). 3  Sartre will later repackage this line with the pithy adage,  existence precedes essence  (1946  2001, 292 ). What this statement suggests is that there is no pre - given or essential nature that determines us, which means that we are always other than ourselves, that we don t fully coincide with who we are. We exist for ourselves as self - making or self - defining beings, and we are always in the process of making or defining ourselves through the situated choices we make as our lives unfold. This is, according to Sartre,  the first principle of existentialism,  and it  means, first, that man exists, turns up, appears on the scene, and, only afterwards, defines himself  (1946  2001, 292 3 ). The point here is that there can be no complete or definitive account of being human because there is nothing that grounds or secures our existence. Existence is fundamentally unsettled and incomplete because we are always projecting forward into possibilities,  hurling ourselves toward a future  as we imagine and re - imagine who we will be. Existence, then, is not a static thing; it is a dynamic process of self - making. Acknowledging existence as a self - making process does not mean the existentialist is denying that there are determinate aspects or  facts  about our situation that limit and constrain us. This is our givenness (or  facticity ), and it includes aspects of our being such as our embodiment and spatiality, our creaturely appetites and desires, and the socio - historical context we find ourselves in. But what distinguishes us as humans is that we have the capacity to rise above or  transcend  these facts in the way we relate to, interpret, and make sense of them. If I am compelled by a strong desire for sex, alcohol, or cigarettes, for instance, I do not out of necessity have to act on these desires. I have the freedom to question them and give them meaning, and the meanings I attribute to them shape my choices and the direction my life will take going forward. This means, unlike other organisms, we are self - conscious beings who can surpass our facticity by calling it into question, interpreting it in different ways, and making decisions about how to deal with it in the future. This is what Kierkegaard means when he describes existence as  a relation that relates to itself  (1849  1989, 43 ). Existence is a reflexive or relational tension between  facticity  and  transcendence,  where we are constrained by our facticity but simultaneously endowed with the freedom to exceed or transcend it. The human being is, as Ortega y Gasset writes,  a kind of ontological centaur, half immersed in nature, half transcending it  (1941, 111). We are not wholly determined by our nature because our nature is always a question or an issue for us. We have the capacity to reflect on and care about it. And the way we care about our nature informs how we create ourselves. Sartre will go so far as to say that human existence is fundamentally  indefinable  and that  there is no human nature  because there is no aspect of our facticity that can fully describe us. Our facticity reveals itself to us only through the self - defining meanings and values that we give to it. If man     is indefinable, it is because at first he is nothing. Only afterward will he be something, and he himself will have made what he will be  (1946  2001, 293 ). This idea that facticity can always be nullified or negated by our choices reveals the key to understanding the existentialist conception of freedom. 4. Freedom Recognizing that there is no pre - given essence that determines existence, the existentialist makes it clear that it is up to the individual to make his, her, or their own identity through choices and actions. Sartre explains that the coward, for instance, is not the way he is because of an unstable childhood or a particular genetic makeup. The coward  makes himself a coward  by means of his decisions (1946  2001, 301 ). In this way, the existentialist generally affirms the view that the human being has free will, is able to make decisions, and can be held responsible for their actions. 4  But, as we will see, this does not mean that we can do whatever we want. It means, rather, that existence is structured by our capacity to give meaning to our situation based on the actions and choices we make as our lives unfold. Insofar as we exist, we are envisioning a certain kind of life, assigning a value to our identity, and making ourselves into the kind of person we are. When we become aware of our freedom as an inescapable given of the human condition, the awareness is often accompanied by anxiety because we realize that we alone are responsible for our choices and the projects we undertake. There is no moral absolute, divine will, or natural law that can provide guidance or justify our actions. We are, in this sense, condemned to be free because  there are no excuses behind us nor justifications before us  (Sartre 1946  2001, 296 ). 4.1 The Anxiety of Choice In the canon of existentialist literature, no writer captures this idea better than Dostoevsky in his Notes from the Underground. The nameless  underground man  rebels against an increasingly scientized, rational, and mechanistic picture of human behavior promoted by Russian social reformers in the 1860 s, where everything a person does was thought to be determined by causal laws. For the underground man, this view reduces the human being to a mechanical cog or  a piano key  (1864  2009, 18 ), and it undermines the one value that gives existence its meaning and dignity, that is, the capacity to choose and create our own lives. 5  To affirm his freedom, the underground man responds to this situation through self - immolating acts of revolt, doing the opposite of whatever the determinations of rationality, social convention, or the laws of nature demand. When he has a toothache, he refuses to see the doctor; when he is at a party with former school mates, he behaves in outrageous and humiliating ways; when the prostitute Liza reaches out to him in tenderness, he lashes out at her in rage. In this sense, the underground man is an anti - hero. He recognizes that freedom is the highest value, the  most advantageous advantage  (1864  2009, 17 ) for human beings, but at the same time he realizes there is no way of knowing what might come of our choices; they may, as they do for the underground man, result in our own self - destruction. As Dostoevsky writes:  What man wants is simply independent choice, whatever that independence may cost and wherever it may lead. And the choice, of course, the devil only knows what choice  (1864  2009, 20 ). This account of freedom suggests that my being (or identity) is always penetrated by the possibility of its own negation because I can always question myself and assign new meanings to and interpretations of who I am in the future. My self - interpretation is always insecure or unstable. I may interpret myself as a philosophy professor today, but I am also not a professor insofar as I can freely choose to reject this identity and resign from my job tomorrow. In this sense, I am no - thing, a  being - possible. As Sartre puts it:  human existence is constituted as a being which is what it is not and which is not what it is  (1943  1956, 107 ). For the existentialist, anxiety discloses this predicament to me, revealing that I ve been abandoned to a realm of possibilities, where I face a dizzying array of options, and I alone am answerable to whatever options I choose. Understood this way, anxiety is not directed at some external object or event in the world. If I am an incarnation of freedom, it is directed at me; I am the source of it. 4.2 Mediated Freedom In Being and Nothingness, Sartre forwards an account of  radical  or  absolute  freedom, an unconditioned  freedom - in - consciousness  where we make or create ourselves ex nihilo, through the sheer  upsurge  of choice alone. But in the wake of Marxist criticism in the 1940 s and 1950 s, his views changed; he realized that this early account was far too abstract, interiorized, and influenced by Cartesian assumptions. 6  It failed to engage the social, historical, and material conditions that invariably limit and constrain our freedom. He came to recognize that our choices and actions are always mediated by the world, by the sociohistorical situation we ve been thrown into. He sees that the idea of radical, unconditioned freedom  is nonsense. The truth is that existence  is - in - society  as it  is - in - the - world   (Sartre 1952  1963, 590 ). Freedom must be understood as  freedom - in - situation. It is true that we are free to create ourselves, but it is also true that we are already created by our situation. Man,  is best understood as  a totally conditioned social being who does not render back completely what his conditioning has given him  (Sartre 1972  2008, 35 ). Sartre s Marxist inspired conception of situated or mediated freedom is one that had already been forwarded and developed by Beauvoir in her major treatises The Second Sex and The Coming of Age and in her novels such as The Blood of Others (1945  1970 ) and The Mandarins (1954  1991 ). The view is also developed by her compatriot Merleau - Ponty. In Phenomenology of Perception, for example, Merleau - Ponty makes it clear that the options we choose to act on do not emerge out of nothing. They are already embedded in a sociohistorical situation  before any personal decision has been made.  (1945  1962, 449 ) The ways in which we create or make ourselves, then, are always circumscribed by the meanings of our situation. We are simultaneously self - making and already made. We exist in both ways at once,  writes Merleau - Ponty. We choose the world, and the world chooses us.  (1945  1962, 453 454 ). As we will see in section 6.3, the recognition of the extent to which freedom is mediated by the material conditions of our situation opened existentialism to a broader engagement with the social sphere and the structures of oppression and violence that shape our experience and self - understanding. 5. Authenticity Existentialism is well known for its critique of mass society and our tendency to conform to the levelled - down norms and expectations of the public. Rather than living our own lives, we tend to get pulled along by the crowd, doing what  they  do. As Heidegger writes,  We take pleasure and enjoy ourselves as they take pleasure. We read, see, and judge about literature and art as they see and judge   we find  shocking  what they find shocking. The  they   prescribes the kind of being of everydayness  (1927  1962, 126 7 ). Living this way can be comforting, creating the illusion that we are living well because we are doing what everyone else does. But for the existentialist, this conformist way of being is a manifestation of inauthenticity or self - deception because it shows how we are unwilling or unable to face up to the freedom and contingency of our condition; it reveals the extent to which we are afraid of being an individual, of being true to ourselves, and of making our own life - defining choices. In The Sickness unto Death, Kierkegaard describes inauthenticity in terms of fleeing from ourselves, of  not wanting to be oneself,  of  wanting to be rid of oneself  (1849  1989, 43 ). Insofar as we let others decide our lives for us, we live a life that is bereft of passion, a life of  bloodless indolence,  where we are unwilling or unable to  make a real commitment.  (Kierkegaard 1846  1946, 266 67 ). Similarly, Heidegger will refer to this condition as a form of estrangement that  alienates Dasein from itself,  where we exist as a  they - self  (Man - selbst) that drifts along in lockstep with others. (1927  1962, 254 55 ) And this self - estrangement is numbing or  tranquilizing  (beruhigend) because it covers over the anxiety of own freedom and finitude. Sartre and Beauvoir refer to inauthenticity in terms of  bad faith  (mauvaise foi), where we either deny or over - identify with one of the two aspects of human existence, either facticity or transcendence. I am in bad faith, for example, when I over - identify with my factical situation and deny my freedom to act on and transform this situation. I am also in bad faith when I over - identify with freedom and deny my past conduct and the fact that my choices are limited and constrained by my situation. Sartre and Beauvoir recognize that the self is never wholly free or wholly determined; it is structurally unstable, it is a  double - property   that is at once a facticity and a transcendence  (Sartre 1943  1956, 98 ). When we cling to one or the other of these poles, we are denying this  double - property,  and this is a denial of the fundamental ambiguity and instability at the core of the human condition. 5.1 The Power of Moods For the existentialists, the possibility of breaking free from engrained patterns of self - deception is generally not something that is accomplished by means of detached reflection. It emerges in the wake of powerful emotional experiences or moods. When the existentialist refers to feelings of  nausea  (Sartre),  absurdity  (Camus),  anxiety  (Kierkegaard),  guilt  (Heidegger), or  mystery  (Marcel) they are describing uncanny affects that have the power to shake us out of our complacency, where the secure and familiar world breaks apart and collapses, and we are forced to confront the question of existence. Jaspers refers to these moments as  limit  or  boundary situations  (Grenzsituationen) situations  when everything that is said to be valuable and true collapses before our eyes  (1932  1956, 117 ). Although terrifying, the existentialist makes it clear that we should not close our eyes or flee from these experiences because they are structural to the human condition. They are, as Jaspers puts it,  impassable, unchangeable situations that belong to human existence as such  (1913  1997, 330 ). Instead of turning away from this basic anxiety, the existentialist asks us to turn toward and face it, because it is amidst a collapsing world that the ultimate questions emerge: Who am I? and What now? In this way, the existentialist sees the experience of anxiety and its related moods as an opportunity for personal growth and transformation. World - shattering moods open me up to the possibility of being authentic, of accepting and affirming the unsettling givens of my condition, of being released from distractions and trivialities, and of recognizing the self - defining projects that matter to me as an individual. 5.2 Kierkegaard s Knight of Faith For Kierkegaard, the authentic individual is someone that is  willing to be one s own self.  (1843  1989, 43 ) He, she, or they recognize(s) that there is more to life than following the crowd or chasing surface pleasures. Such a life is invariably scattered and disjointed, pulled apart by temporal desires and the fleeting fads and fashions of the public. Authenticity requires a passionate,  personality defining  (personligheds definerende) decision or commitment that binds together and unifies the fragmented and disjointed moments of our life into a focused and coherent whole. The  unifying power  of commitment is embodied in, what Kierkegaard calls, an attitude of  earnestness  (alvor), a sober recognition that existence is a serious affair, not a pleasure - seeking masquerade. But authenticity cannot be achieved simply by means of renouncing temporal pleasures and doing one s duty according to some universal moral principle such as the Ten Commandments or Kant s Categorical Imperative. This is because, for Kierkegaard, the subjective truth of the individual is higher than the universal truths of morality. And this means there may be times in our lives where we must suspend our obligation to the ethical sphere and accept the terrible fact that it may be more important to be authentic (to be true to oneself) than it is to be moral (to do what is right.) In Fear and Trembling, Kierkegaard draws on the biblical figure of Abraham to make this point. As a father, Abraham has a moral duty to love and protect his son, but when God demands that he break this commandment and kill Isaac, he is confronted with a personal truth that is higher than the universal. In committing himself to this truth, Abraham becomes a  knight of faith  by  leaping  (springer) into a paradox, one where the truth of  the singular individual is higher than the universal  (1843  1985, 84 ). As a religious existentialist, Kierkegaard contends that this is what is required to enter the sphere of faith and become a Christian. It has nothing to do with membership in a congregation or obedience to doctrinal statements. It is, rather, a willingness to commit to a truth that is fundamentally irrational and absurd. How, for example, can one make rational sense of God s command to Abraham to kill his own son? The problem,  writes Kierkegaard,  is not to understand Christianity, but to understand that it cannot be understood  (1835 1854  1959, 146 ). 7  An authentic or religious life, then, is always accompanied by anxiety and loneliness because the leap individualizes us; it cuts us off from the comforting truths of the public and its blanket conceptions of right and wrong. It compels us to follow a path that no one else may understand. Abraham s decision is, for this reason, fraught with despair. In his willingness to suspend his moral duty, he appears  insane  because he  cannot make himself understood to anyone.  (1985 (1843 , 103) But with the despair of faith comes feelings of intensity, even joy, as we recognize the absurdity of religious existence, that the eternal or divine is not found in some otherworldly realm, it is bound up in the temporal; that it is this life, the finite, that has infinite significance. Freed from the temptations of the crowd and of blind obedience to moral principles, the knight of faith  takes delight in everything he sees  because he is now fully aware of the majesty and richness of finitude. For him,  finitude tastes just as good as to one who has never known anything higher  (1843  1985, 69 70 ). 5.3 Nietzsche s Overman Like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche is critical of our tendency to follow the herd and cling to universal moral principles. He forwards a conception of authenticity that accepts our nihilistic predicament and rises above Christian values of good and evil. He sees these values as representative of a tame and submissive way of being, a  slave morality  (Sklavenmoral) that is subservient to authority and bereft of any originality or style. Nietzsche contrasts this with a  master morality  (Herrenmoral) embodied in those who have the courage to face, even affirm, the cruel and tragic aspects of life and the self - directed power to create their own meanings and values against the backdrop of God s death. Nietzsche refers to the individual who can overcome the meek and slavish values of tradition for the sake of self - creation as an  Overman  ( bermensch), an aristocratic figure who embodies the freedom, courage, and strength to be original, that is, to  give style  to life. Such spirits,  writes Nietzsche,  are always out of fashion or explain themselves and their surroundings as free nature wild, arbitrary, fantastic, and surprising  (1887  1974 ,  290). The key to living with style is, for Nietzsche, a radical acceptance of one s existence and the world as it is, embracing all our strengths and weaknesses and all the blessed and cursed events that have been and will be. The Overman is a  yes - sayer  who affirms every aspect of his life,  every truth, even the simple, bitter, ugly, unchristian, immoral truths  (1887  1996 ,  1). In The Gay Science, Nietzsche captures this attitude with a famous thought experiment called the  doctrine of eternal recurrence. Here, he asks if we have the audacity to live the same life we are living now over and over for eternity. And there will be nothing new about it,  he explains,  but every pain and every pleasure, and every thought and sigh, and everything unspeakably small and great in your life must come back to you and all in the same series and sequence. On Nietzsche s view, most of us would recoil in horror at the prospect of eternally suffering through the same boredom, failures, and disappointments. But overflowing with amor fati (love of one s fate), the Overman welcomes this possibility, proclaiming,  I have never heard anything more godlike  (1887  1974 ,  341). Camus describes this attitude as a form of rebellion against servile and conformist ways of being. Like the Overman,  the rebel  is someone  born of abundance and fullness of spirit,  and he embodies  the unreserved affirmation of human imperfection and suffering, of evil and murder, of all that is problematic and strange in our existence. It is born of an arrested wish to be what one is in a world that is what it is  (1951  1956, 72 ). But not everyone has the inborn power to rebel against tradition and creatively express their unique style of living. For Nietzsche, only  the highest types  can manifest this kind of freedom and capacity for self - overcoming. To this end, his account of authenticity is unapologetically elitist and anti - democratic. Most of us are too mired in self - deception, too frightened and weak to break with the herd and become who we are. Only a very few people can be free,  writes Nietzsche,  It is a prerogative of the strong  (1886  1998 ,  29). 5.4 Heidegger s Resolute Dasein Heidegger devotes much of the second half of Being and Time to an analysis of authenticity, employing the German term Eigentlichkeit formed from the stem of the adjective eigen ( own  or  property ) that literally means  being own s own  or  ownnness. But he sets up his analysis of authenticity by first claiming that self - deception or  inauthenticity  is unavoidable; it is a structure of the human condition, one that he refers to as  falling  (Verfallen). What this means is that in our everyday lives we invariably conform (or  fall prey ) to the norms and values of the public world. This results in a kind of complacency and indifference about the question of existence, where we are not our own selves, where  everyone is the other, and no one is himself  (1927  1962, 128 ). Falling creates the illusion that our existence (or being - in - the - world) is secure and thing - like because we are doing what everyone else does. But, for Heidegger, there is nothing that fundamentally secures our existence. As a self - making activity, I am not a stable thing. I am nothing, a  not yet  (noch nicht) that is always unsettled, always in the process of making myself. The awareness of our own unsettledness emerges in moments of anxiety when the familiar and routinized world  collapses into itself  (1927  1962, 186 ), and I  die  (sterben) because I am no longer able - to - be, that is, to understand or make sense of who I am. 8  Like Kierkegaard, Heidegger interprets anxiety as an individualizing mood, one that momentarily  snatches one back  from the tranquilizing routines of  the They,  leaving us vulnerable and exposed to confront our lives (1927  1962, 384 ). And this is potentially liberating because it can temporarily free us from patterns of self - deception, providing insight, a  moment of vision  (Augenblick) that can give our lives a renewed sense of urgency and focus. But this experience of individuation does not detach me from the world, turning me into a radical subject or  free floating  I   (1927  1962, 298 ). Heidegger claims that our self - defining choices are always guided in advance by our historical embeddedness, what he calls  historicity  (Geschichtlichkeit). The meanings we choose to give to our lives, then, are not created out of thin air; they have already been interpreted and made intelligible by a historical community or  people  (Volk). 9  The moment of vision shakes me out of my fallen, everyday existence and allows me to come back to my historical world with fresh eyes, to seize hold of the publicly interpreted meanings that matter to me and make them  mine  (Jemeinig). Heidegger refers to this authentic attitude in terms of  resoluteness  (Entschlossenheit), where I  pull  myself  together,  giving life a sense of cohesion and focus that was missing when I was lost and scattered in  the They. But being resolute does not mean that I stubbornly cling to whatever possibilities I happen to choose. For Heidegger, authenticity demands an openness and flexibility with how I interpret myself. 10  Understanding that existence is a situated process of self - making, whatever values or meanings I commit myself to, I must also be willing to let go or give up on them depending on the circumstances of my life, that is, to  hold  myself  free for the possibility of taking it back  (1927  1962, 308 ). Resoluteness, on this view, does not mean  becoming rigid  and holding fast to a chosen identity because my self - understanding is always insecure; it can die at any time. For this reason, authenticity requires  readiness  or  anticipation  (Vorgriff), where we passionately hold ourselves open and free for the inescapable breakdowns and emergencies of life. It is, in Heidegger s words,  an impassioned freedom towards death a freedom which has been released from the illusions of the  They   (1927  1962, 266 ). 5.5 Self - Recovery in Sartre and Beauvoir Sartre and Beauvoir follow Heidegger in viewing self - deception as structural to the human condition. It is, as Sartre writes,  an immediate, permanent threat to every project of the human being  (1943  1956, 116 ). Although I can certainly deceive myself by over - identifying with freedom and denying the extent to which my possibilities are constrained by facticity, the most common and familiar form of bad faith is when I over - identify with my facticity, as if I were a fully realized object or thing, a being  in - itself  (en - soi). This form of self - deception is understandable as it creates the consoling impression that there is something secure and thing - like about my identity, that  I am what I am,  and there is nothing that can change me. But to live this way is to deny my freedom and transcendence, that I am self - making, that I live for myself or, in the vernacular of Sartre and Beauvoir,  for - itself  (pour - soi). Human beings are, on their view, always in the process of making or constituting themselves, modifying and negating their being through moment - to - moment choices and actions. This means my identity is never fixed or stable because I can always choose to take a new path or interpret myself in other ways. Regardless of how I see myself at a given time as a professor, a father, or a political activist I am also  not  that person, because my identity is never realized and complete; I am always free to negate a given identity and define myself differently in the future. This means I am  what I am not  (1943  1956, 103 ). And this situation appears to undermine the prospect of authenticity altogether. If the self is always unstable, always in question, how can I ever be genuine or true to myself? In Being and Nothingness, Sartre provides an answer, referring to authenticity in terms of a  recovery  (r cup ration) of a self or way of being  that was previously corrupted  (1943  1956, 116 ). 11  But this act of  self - recovery  has nothing to do with creating or holding on to a particular identity. It involves, rather, a clear - eyed awareness and acceptance of the instability and ambiguity of the human condition. And, along with this acceptance, a willingness to act in the face of this ambiguity and to take responsibility, however horrible, for wherever these actions might lead. As Sartre writes,  authenticity consists in a lucid consciousness of the situation, in assuming the responsibilities and risks it involves, in accepting it     sometimes with horror and hate  (1946  1948, 90 ). But just because existence is fundamentally ambiguous does not mean that our chosen projects are meaningless or absurd. My projects have meaning and value because I chose these projects, but the meaning is contingent; it is never enduring or stable. In The Ethics of Ambiguity, Beauvoir explains:  The notion of ambiguity must not be confused with that of absurdity. To declare that existence is absurd is to deny that it can ever be given a meaning; to say that it is ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is never fixed  (1947  1948, 129 ). The point of authenticity, then, is not to be concerned with who I am because, at bottom, I am nothing. It is to be concerned with what I do. As Sartre writes,  Authenticity reveals that the only meaningful project is that of doing (not that of being)  (1948  1992, 475 ). For Sartre and Beauvoir, to be authentic is to recover and accept the ambiguous tension of the self, that: we are who we are not and we are not who are. And by means of this recovery, recognize that the task of existence involves acting and doing, that is, realizing our freedom through projects in the world but also, as we will see, taking responsibility for how these projects might enhance or diminish freedom for others. 6. Ethics Existentialist ethics generally begins with the idea that there is no external moral order or table of values that exists a priori. It must be understood,  as Beauvoir writes in The Ethics of Ambiguity,  that the passion in which man has acquiesced finds no external justification. No outside appeal, no objective necessity permits of its being called useful. But this does not mean that the existentialists are promoting a form of moral nihilism. Beauvoir admits it is true that the human being  has no reason to will itself. But this does not mean that it cannot justify itself, that it cannot give itself reasons for being that it does not have. It is human existence itself  which makes values spring up in the world on the basis of which it will be able to judge the enterprise in which it will be engaged.  (1947  1948, 12, 15 ). 12  There is, then, a coherent account of ethical responsibility grounded in freedom, not as a theoretical abstraction but as a concrete expression of transcendence, and the obligation to help others realize their own freedom so that I can realize mine. When I acknowledge that freedom is my essence, I must also acknowledge that it is the essence of others and work, to the best of my ability, to help them realize it. My freedom, then, is not free - floating; it is invariably bound up in the freedom of others. As Sartre puts it:  We want freedom for freedom s sake and in every particular circumstance. And in wanting freedom we discover that it depends entirely on the freedom of others, and that freedom of others depends on ours     I am obliged to want others to have freedom at the same time that I want my own freedom  (1945  2001, 306 ). 6.1 Authentic Being - for - Others Sartre and Beauvoir argue that we generally exist as  a being - for - others  (un  tre - pour - autrui), which is to say that I understand or see myself in the way that I do through  the look  (le regard) of the Other. And the look has the power to strip away my freedom and turn me into an object. Human relations, on this account, are best understood as a form of conflict, a dyadic power struggle where I try to assert my freedom and subjectivity by turning the Other into an object, while the Other tries to do the same to me. While I attempt to free myself from the hold of the Other,  writes Sartre,  the Other is trying to free himself from mine; while I seek to enslave the Other, the Other seeks to enslave me  Conflict is the original meaning of being - for - others  (1943  1956, 475 ). This struggle for self - assertion leads to Sartre s famous claim in his play Huis Clos (No Exit) that  Hell is other people  (1944  1989, 45 ). But the struggle to objectify and possess the Other by stripping them of their freedom is a manifestation of inauthentic being - for - others. There is an authentic counterpart. Beauvoir, for example, explores what it means to develop and cultivate freedom for others with her account of  authentic love  (l amour authentique), describing it as a relationship where we acknowledge and nurture the other s freedom and transcendence while at the same time resisting the temptations of bad faith, that is, to see the Other as an object or thing to be manipulated and possessed. As a moral stance, authentic being - for - others is a form of reciprocity that involves  the mutual recognition of two freedoms      where  neither would give up transcendence  and  neither would be mutilated  (1949  1952, 667 ). In this way authenticity and morality belong together, whereby we have a shared obligation to liberate or free each other so that we can create ourselves and take responsibility for the life we lead. Therefore, as Beauvoir puts it,  to will oneself moral and to will oneself free are one and the same decision  (1947  1948, 24 ). Heidegger develops a similar idea in Being and Time with his account of  liberating concern  (befreiend F rsorge), a form of care where the central aim is to free the Other from patterns of self - deception so that they can anxiously face and create their own existence. It is a relational stance that  helps the Other become transparent to himself in his care and to become free for it  (1927  1962, 122 ). When we care in this way, we resist the temptation to  leap - in  (einspringen) for the Other, as if the Other were a dependent thing or object that needs to be sheltered from the unsettling question of existence. Heidegger refers to this sheltering tendency in terms of a kind of tacit mastery or  domination  (Beherrschung) that strips the Other of the anxious responsibility they have for their own life. Instead of leaping - in for the Other and disburdening them of their responsibility, an authentic relation is one that  leaps - ahead  (vorausspringt) of the Other, giving them back their anxiety and the freedom to care for and confront their condition. As Heidegger writes, we leap - ahead of the Other,  not in order to take away his  care  but rather to give it back to them authentically as such for the first time  (1927  1962, 122 ). Here, we see the development of an ethical maxim: to act in such a way as to will the realization of your own freedom and the realization of freedom for others. 6.2 The Ethics of Recognition There is also heterodox current among some religious existentialists, one that suggests that moral demands are placed on us when we recognize ourselves not as voluntaristic subjects or, in the words of Iris Murdoch,  brave naked wills  (1983, 46) severed from bonds of community and attachment but as relational beings who are fundamentally bound together in mutual vulnerability. And this recognition may serve as the foundation for an ethics by pulling us out of our everyday self - absorption and awakening us, not to our freedom, but to our essential dependency. Speaking through the religious elder Father Zossima in The Brothers Karamazov, Dostoevsky offers a powerful indictment of the  terrible individualism  that he sees as endemic to modernity, where unfettered freedom and self - affirmation have become the highest values. Such a view leads not to self - actualization but to loneliness and despair. The modern man, says Zossima,  is accustomed to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the whole; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others, in men and in humanity     but this terrible individualism must inevitably have an end, and all will suddenly understand how unnaturally they are separated from one another  (1879  1957 80, 279 ). Against the vision of the willful subject who makes choices without evaluative limits or constraints, Dostoevsky suggests it is only in recognizing the Other as dependent and vulnerable that we can come to recognize ourselves. True freedom emerges when we release ourselves from the bondage of our own egoistic striving and adopt an attitude of humility and self - sacrifice. The aim is to show that the human being is not an isolated will but a frail and defenseless being that is dependent on the self - less love, compassion, and charity of others. 13  When we free ourselves from the temptations of individualism in this way, Zossima says a moral demand is placed on us, one where we begin to see that  we are all responsible to all and for all  (1879 80  1957, 228). The Jewish existentialist Martin Buber expands on this idea in his masterwork I and Thou. He claims that in our everyday lives we generally relate to others from an instrumental and objectifying standpoint, what he calls the  I - It  (Ich - Es) relation, where the other is encountered as a thing (or  it ) to be manipulated and controlled for one s own use. This relation is comforting because it creates the illusion that we have control of our situation. But there are moments in our lives when this illusion collapses, and we become vulnerable to the other, not as an  it  but as a  you. In the  I - You  (Ich - Du) relation, all the egoistic defenses we rely on to conceal our essential dependency and openness to the Other break down. Buber refers to this as an experience of grace, where the Other is revealed to me as a whole person, defenseless and exposed, and I am revealed in the same way. It is a moment where  two human beings reveal the You to one another  (1923  1970, 95 ). In this way, anxiety isn t a radically individualizing affair, where the forlorn subject is cut off from the relational world to confront their own freedom. For Buber, exposure to the I - You relation shakes us out of our own egoistic concerns and awakens us to the fact that we are not isolated individuals but beings who are always in living relation with others. With this experience  the barriers of the individual are breached,  and this creates an affective union, a  bridge from self - being to self - being across the abyss of dread  (1938  1965 , 201, 207 ). 6.3 The Ethics of Engagement The Nazi occupation of France, his own experience as a prisoner of war, and the attacks on his philosophy from influential Marxist critics, compelled Sartre to shift his focus from the individual to the social. Following the war, he, along with Merleau - Ponty and Beauvoir, launched the influential journal of social criticism Le Temps Modernes (Modern Times), and Sartre made his aims clear in the first issue, writing:  Our intention is to help effect certain changes in the Society that surrounds us  one is responsible for what one is   Totally committed and totally freed. And yet it is the free man who must be delivered, by enlarging his possibilities of choice  (Sartre 1945  1988, 264 65 ). Here we see existentialists making the connection that for the Other to realize their freedom, philosophy must engage the  bases and structures  that limit and constrain them. This is because these structures are not philosophical abstractions; they  are lived as schematic determinates of the individual s future  (Sartre 1957  1968, 94 ). Society, here, is viewed not as an aggregate of voluntaristic subjects; it is the mediating background of our lives, and if we are going to create a situation of freedom and  enlarge the possibilities of choice,  we must recognize how this background can be violent and oppressive especially to historically marginalized and undervalued people and to act in such a way as to transform it. Of all the major developers of existentialism, it is unquestionably Beauvoir who offered the most sustained and influential analyses of oppression and of possibilities for emancipation, not only in her feminist masterwork The Second Sex, but in her bleak account of the dehumanization of the elderly in The Coming of Age (1970  1996 ) and her reflections on the experience of Black populations in the Jim Crow South in her memoir America Day by Day (1954  1999 ). In these works, Beauvoir illuminates how socioeconomic and political structures can restrict the human capacity for freedom and transcendence, how they have the power to  freeze  the Other, strip away possibilities for agency and self - creation, and trap them in  immanence. But in these works, Beauvoir makes it clear that this situation is not a destiny. Human beings have no essential nature; no one is born inferior or submissive. We are constituted intersubjectively by growing into, internalizing, and enacting ready - made structures of oppression. But insofar as these structures are constituted and maintained by the choices and actions of individuals, they are not fixed and static. Like human beings, they too are subject to change. Here we see how the recognition that existence precedes essence moves from the ontological realm to the ethical, it becomes a call to action, to engage and transform the material conditions that limit the possibilities of choice for those who are oppressed and marginalized. In this way, postwar existentialism began to engage the realities of the social sphere and the painful  isms  classism, racism, colonialism, sexism, anti - Semitism haunting the western world. It was a philosophy that had come to recognize, in Sartre s words, that  the individual interiorizes his social determinations; he interiorizes the relations of production, the family of his childhood, the historical past, the contemporary in institutions, and he then re - exteriorizes these acts and options which necessarily refer us back to them  (1972  2008, 35 ). And insofar as these social determinations are not fixed and timeless but contingent human constructs, they can be resisted and transformed to free others. 7. Contemporary Relevance Existentialism has had a profound impact on how philosophers conceptualize and understand the human condition, with rich accounts of affectivity and embodiment, facticity (or worldliness), and the ways in which we are constituted intersubjectively. It has opened new paths for philosophy to engage with concrete and acute human problems, from sexuality, race, disability, and old age to broader issues of social and political violence and oppressive relations in general. And the movement continues to thrive in the academy today. Not only is the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP) flourishing as the second largest philosophical organization in the English - speaking world, with smaller research groups (or  Circles ) devoted to every major figure. There is a cascade of scholarship published every year in leading journals and academic presses that captures the enduring relevance of existentialist thought, including important new work engaging the significance of French existentialism as an ethical theory (Webber 2018), reframing our conceptions of virtue and human flourishing (McMullin 2019), and even addressing current analytic debates in philosophies of life - extension, anti - natalism, and transhumanism (Buben 2022). Indeed, the core ideas and major figures of existentialism are not just alive and well; they are shaping developments in a diverse range of areas across the humanities and social sciences. 7.1 Post - Structuralism The legacy is most clearly present in the European philosophies that proceeded it. Existentialism s critique of foundationalism and the authority of reason as well as its rejection of universalism, essentialism, and  grand narratives  (or metanarratives) all had a decisive impact on post - structural philosophies in France. Nietzsche and Heidegger in particular served as decisive influences on the project of  de - centering the subject  in Jacques Derrida s method of deconstruction and in Michel Foucault s genealogy of power, demonstrating how the subject is not the privileged center or origin of truth and knowledge. The subject is, rather, shaped in advance by sociohistorical structures, an overlapping network of norms and practices, linguistic conventions, and shared meanings, and this shaping takes place in a way that we are never fully conscious of. 14  The individual, on this view, is more of a placeholder or crossing point in these anonymous structures, where the subject exists as  the inscribed surface of events     totally imprinted by history  (Foucault 1977, 148). Of course, existentialists reject the idea that this historical imprinting or  decentering  is total or absolute. They are, after all, still committed to the value of freedom and authenticity, but they recognize that freedom is never unconditioned. Beyond the philosophies of Heidegger and Nietzsche, we see this recognition in Merleau - Ponty s conception of mediated freedom, in Sartre s postwar account of  freedom - in - situation,  and in what Beauvoir calls  la force des choses  (the power of circumstances). The recognition of historicity as an impersonal force that structures our identity had such an impact on Foucault s work that he once remarked:  My entire philosophical development was determined by my reading of Heidegger  (Foucault 1985, cited in Dreyfus 1995, 9). 7.2 Narrative and Hermeneutic Philosophy In viewing the self not as a substance or thing but as a self - interpreting, meaning - giving activity that is always already bound up in the world, existentialism has also informed key developments in narrative and hermeneutic philosophy. Prominent anglophone philosophers such as Harry Frankfurt (1971), Charles Taylor (1985), and Alasdair MacIntyre (1981) have drawn on classical existentialism to illuminate how we exist in the meanings and self - interpretations that we create for ourselves. My sense of who I am is constituted by an ongoing process of choosing, pulling together, and consolidating the roles, projects, and meanings that matter to me and that are made available by the sociohistorical situation I find myself in. On this view, the story I create for myself is held together by the narrative unity and cohesion that I give to it. This is what Taylor means when he says that we can only understand or  grasp our lives in a narrative  (1989, 47). And this conception of narrative identity not only offers a response to overly reductive conceptions of the self that are grounded in the substance ontologies of mind and body; it demonstrates an attentiveness to the ambiguous tension of our condition, that our choices are both self - fashioning and socially embedded, that we simultaneously make ourselves and are already made. 7.3 Philosophy of Mind and Cognitive Science Beginning with Hubert Dreyfus s (1972) groundbreaking critique of Artificial Intelligence (AI), philosophers of mind and cognitive scientists have been drawing on existentialist philosophy especially Heidegger and Merleau - Ponty to challenge the overly mentalistic picture of selfhood and agency that modern philosophy inherits from Descartes and Kant and to dismantle traditional representational theories of knowledge. Key works by Shaun Gallagher (2005), Thomas Fuchs, (2018), and Dan Zahavi (2005) have replaced the picture of the disembodied mind with the now widely accepted notion of the embedded, enactive, and embodied self. This is a rejection of the long - held assumption that human action must somehow be represented or  mirrored  in the mind. Existentialism illuminates how as a situated way of being - in - the - world human beings already embody a tacit understanding of the world in a way that we are not and can never be thematically conscious of. This means we do not understand things as discrete objects. We understand things in terms of how we use and handle them and in terms of the purposive, meaning - giving roles these things play in our everyday lives. The traditional view of the mind as something resembling the rule - governed processes of a computer program have continually failed to capture this ambiguous and embodied sense of being - in - the - world. 7.4 Critical Phenomenology The attentiveness to conditions of oppression, subjugation, and violence among postwar existentialists in France has had a decisive impact on recent developments in critical phenomenology by giving voice to those who have been historically marginalized or undervalued in the western tradition. Beauvoir s pioneering account of the woman s experience in The Second Sex is well known for laying the conceptual foundations for second wave feminism, and her late career phenomenology of aging broke new ground by shedding light on the existence of older persons and exposing the toxic ageism in contemporary capitalist societies. Together with Sartre and Merleau - Ponty, her ideas would inform Franz Fanon s Black Skin, White Masks (1952  1967 ), a seminal work that disclosed the dehumanizing experience of colonized Black populations and helped give birth to Africana critical theory or  black existentialism  (Gordon 2000). The focus on the ways in which structures of discrimination along with the limits of our own embodiment can constrain our capacities for freedom and transcendence has, in turn, influenced recent phenomenological accounts of intersectionality and the lived experience of, among others, indigenous peoples, immigrants, and exiles (Coulthard 2014; Ortega 2016), queer and trans identities (Ahmed 2006; Salamon 2010), those who are imprisoned or in solitary confinement (Guenther 2013; Leder 2016), and the elderly, disabled, and chronically ill (Aho 2022; Reynolds 2022; Dickel 2022). 7.5 Comparative and Environmental Philosophy Interpreting existence in terms of the situated activity of being - in - the - world not only serves as a rejection of substance ontology and the metaphysical dualisms (subject - object; mind - body; inner - outer) that we inherit from Cartesian and empiricist epistemologies; it also reveals deep affinities with the nonduality of Buddhism and other incarnations of Eastern thought. (Loy 2018; Kalmanson 2020) And the recognition of our enmeshment in the world has informed a range of important advances in the philosophy of place, deep ecology, and eco - phenomenology (Brown   Toadvine 2003; Malpas 2017; Morton 2016; Rentmeester 2016). These endeavors have exposed the limitations of the scientific worldview and our uncritical dependence on technological innovation to address the current ecological crisis. Modern science generally assumes a binary paradigm of the subject as separate and distinct from a value - less domain of objects (or nature), a domain that can, in turn, be mastered and controlled by technoscience. In this way, it betrays our ordinary experience, that in our day - to - day lives we are not atomistic, self - certain subjects but beings that are fundamentally entwined with the world and the meaning and value that this intertwining brings to our experience. For the existentialist, then, extricating ourselves from environmental doom requires not a technoscientific fix but an ontological transformation in our own self - understanding, an awaking to the reality of our interdependence with nature, that the earth is not apart from us but rather part of us. 7.6 Philosophy of Health and Illness Outside of the humanities and social sciences, existentialism has also had a deep and lasting impact on the allied health professions. The role it has played in the development of existential and humanistic approaches to psychotherapy (Cooper 2003; Spinneli 2007; van Deurzen 2015) and to phenomenological psychopathology (Parnas   Gallagher 2015; Ratcliffe 2015; Stanghellini et al. 2019) is well - known, but in recent years we have seen its influence emerge in a range of different areas, from narrative medicine to nursing, and from gerontology to palliative care. To this end, existentialism has informed a move away from the reductive and objectifying tendencies of modern biomedicine to recover the first - person experience of health and illness, viewing the body not so much as a biophysical machine that needs to be adjusted and maintained but as the experiential and interpretative medium of our existence. This shift has not only allowed clinicians to challenge the emergent tendency to medicalize ever - expanding swaths of the human condition; it makes it possible for the clinician to better understand the patient s experience by getting a sense of  what it means  and  what it feels like  to suffer when the body breaks down (Aho 2018; Slatman 2014; Svenaeus 2022; Zeiler   K ll 2014). 7.7 A New Generation Beyond its ascendency in the healing arts, its myriad cultural influences, and its wide - ranging impact on the humanities and social sciences, the enduring legacy of existentialism is perhaps most visible in the classroom. Existentialist - themed courses are often among the most popular in the philosophy curriculum as young students confront, for the first time, the unsettling questions of freedom and the meaning of their own existence. And these questions have never been more pressing as they develop against the backdrop of anthropogenic climate change, species extinction, global pandemics, and the reemergence of authoritarian and fascist politics. Amidst these planetary emergencies, a new generation is facing the predicament of nihilism and the death of God and owning up to the uncanny truth of the human condition: that existence precedes essence.

The word existentialism, however, was not coined until the mid 20 th century, during which it became most associated with contemporaneous philosophers Jean - Paul Sartre, Martin Heidegger, Simone de Beauvoir, Karl Jaspers, Gabriel Marcel, Paul Tillich, and more controversially Albert Camus. Many existentialists considered traditional systematic or academic philosophies, in style and content, to be too abstract and removed from concrete human experience. 8  9  A primary virtue in existentialist thought is authenticity. 10  Existentialism would influence many disciplines outside of philosophy, including theology, drama, art, literature, and psychology. 11  Existentialist philosophy encompasses a range of perspectives, but it shares certain underlying concepts. Among these, a central tenet of existentialism is that personal freedom, individual responsibility, and deliberate choice are essential to the pursuit of self - discovery and the determination of life's meaning. 12  Etymology edit  The term existentialism (French: L'existentialisme) was coined by the French Catholic philosopher Gabriel Marcel in the mid - 1940 s. 13  14  15  When Marcel first applied the term to Jean - Paul Sartre, at a colloquium in 1945, Sartre rejected it. 16  Sartre subsequently changed his mind and, on October 29, 1945, publicly adopted the existentialist label in a lecture to the Club Maintenant in Paris, published as L'existentialisme est un humanisme (Existentialism Is a Humanism), a short book that helped popularize existentialist thought. 17  Marcel later came to reject the label himself in favour of Neo - Socratic, in honor of Kierkegaard's essay \"On the Concept of Irony\". Some scholars argue that the term should be used to refer only to the cultural movement in Europe in the 1940 s and 1950 s associated with the works of the philosophers Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau - Ponty, and Albert Camus. 5  Others extend the term to Kierkegaard, and yet others extend it as far back as Socrates. 18  However, it is often identified with the philosophical views of Sartre. 5  Definitional issues and background edit  The labels existentialism and existentialist are often seen as historical conveniences in as much as they were first applied to many philosophers long after they had died. While existentialism is generally considered to have originated with Kierkegaard, the first prominent existentialist philosopher to adopt the term as a self - description was Sartre. Sartre posits the idea that \"what all existentialists have in common is the fundamental doctrine that existence precedes essence\", as the philosopher Frederick Copleston explains. 19  According to philosopher Steven Crowell, defining existentialism has been relatively difficult, and he argues that it is better understood as a general approach used to reject certain systematic philosophies rather than as a systematic philosophy itself. 5  In a lecture delivered in 1945, Sartre described existentialism as \"the attempt to draw all the consequences from a position of consistent atheism\". 20  For others, existentialism need not involve the rejection of God, but rather \"examines mortal man's search for meaning in a meaningless universe\", considering less \"What is the good life?\" (to feel, be, or do, good), instead asking \"What is life good for?\". 21  Although many outside Scandinavia consider the term existentialism to have originated from Kierkegaard, it is more likely that Kierkegaard adopted this term (or at least the term \"existential\" as a description of his philosophy) from the Norwegian poet and literary critic Johan Sebastian Cammermeyer Welhaven. 22  This assertion comes from two sources: The Norwegian philosopher Erik Lundestad refers to the Danish philosopher Fredrik Christian Sibbern. Sibbern is supposed to have had two conversations in 1841, the first with Welhaven and the second with Kierkegaard. It is in the first conversation that it is believed that Welhaven came up with \"a word that he said covered a certain thinking, which had a close and positive attitude to life, a relationship he described as existential\". 23  This was then brought to Kierkegaard by Sibbern. The second claim comes from the Norwegian historian Rune Slagstad, who claimed to prove that Kierkegaard himself said the term existential was borrowed from the poet. He strongly believes that it was Kierkegaard himself who said that \"Hegelians do not study philosophy 'existentially;' to use a phrase by Welhaven from one time when I spoke with him about philosophy.\" 24  Concepts edit  Existence precedes essence edit  Main article: Existence precedes essence Sartre argued that a central proposition of existentialism is that existence precedes essence, which is to say that individuals shape themselves by existing and cannot be perceived through preconceived and a priori categories, an \"essence\". The actual life of the individual is what constitutes what could be called their \"true essence\" instead of an arbitrarily attributed essence others use to define them. Human beings, through their own consciousness, create their own values and determine a meaning to their life. 25  This view is in contradiction to Aristotle and Aquinas, who taught that essence precedes individual existence. 26  Although it was Sartre who explicitly coined the phrase, similar notions can be found in the thought of existentialist philosophers such as Heidegger, and Kierkegaard: .mw - parser - output .templatequote overflow:hidden;margin:1 em 0;padding:0 32 px .mw - parser - output .templatequotecite line - height:1.5 em;text - align:left;margin - top:0  media(min - width:500 px) .mw - parser - output .templatequotecite padding - left:1.6 em  The subjective thinker's form, the form of his communication, is his style. His form must be just as manifold as are the opposites that he holds together. The systematic eins, zwei, drei is an abstract form that also must inevitably run into trouble whenever it is to be applied to the concrete. To the same degree as the subjective thinker is concrete, to that same degree his form must also be concretely dialectical. But just as he himself is not a poet, not an ethicist, not a dialectician, so also his form is none of these directly. His form must first and last be related to existence, and in this regard he must have at his disposal the poetic, the ethical, the dialectical, the religious. Subordinate character, setting, etc., which belong to the well - balanced character of the esthetic production, are in themselves breadth; the subjective thinker has only one setting existence and has nothing to do with localities and such things. The setting is not the fairyland of the imagination, where poetry produces consummation, nor is the setting laid in England, and historical accuracy is not a concern. The setting is inwardness in existing as a human being; the concretion is the relation of the existence - categories to one another. Historical accuracy and historical actuality are breadth. S ren Kierkegaard (Concluding Postscript, Hong pp. 357 358.) Some interpret the imperative to define oneself as meaning that anyone can wish to be anything. However, an existentialist philosopher would say such a wish constitutes an inauthentic existence   what Sartre would call \"bad faith\". Instead, the phrase should be taken to say that people are defined only insofar as they act and that they are responsible for their actions. Someone who acts cruelly towards other people is, by that act, defined as a cruel person. Such persons are themselves responsible for their new identity (cruel persons). This is opposed to their genes, or human nature, bearing the blame. As Sartre said in his lecture Existentialism is a Humanism: \"Man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world and defines himself afterwards.\" The more positive, therapeutic aspect of this is also implied: a person can choose to act in a different way, and to be a good person instead of a cruel person. 27  Jonathan Webber interprets Sartre's usage of the term essence not in a modal fashion, i.e. as necessary features, but in a teleological fashion: \"an essence is the relational property of having a set of parts ordered in such a way as to collectively perform some activity\". 28 : 3  5  For example, it belongs to the essence of a house to keep the bad weather out, which is why it has walls and a roof. Humans are different from houses because unlike houses they do not have an inbuilt purpose: they are free to choose their own purpose and thereby shape their essence; thus, their existence precedes their essence. 28 : 1 4 Sartre is committed to a radical conception of freedom: nothing fixes our purpose but we ourselves, our projects have no weight or inertia except for our endorsement of them. 29  30  Simone de Beauvoir, on the other hand, holds that there are various factors, grouped together under the term sedimentation, that offer resistance to attempts to change our direction in life. Sedimentations are themselves products of past choices and can be changed by choosing differently in the present, but such changes happen slowly. They are a force of inertia that shapes the agent's evaluative outlook on the world until the transition is complete. 28 : 5, 9, 66 Sartre's definition of existentialism was based on Heidegger's magnum opus Being and Time (1927). In the correspondence with Jean Beaufret later published as the Letter on Humanism, Heidegger implied that Sartre misunderstood him for his own purposes of subjectivism, and that he did not mean that actions take precedence over being so long as those actions were not reflected upon. 31  Heidegger commented that \"the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement\", meaning that he thought Sartre had simply switched the roles traditionally attributed to essence and existence without interrogating these concepts and their history. 32  The absurd edit  Main article: Absurdism Sisyphus, the symbol of the absurdity of existence, painting by Franz Stuck (1920) The notion of the absurd contains the idea that there is no meaning in the world beyond what meaning we give it. This meaninglessness also encompasses the amorality or \"unfairness\" of the world. This can be highlighted in the way it opposes the traditional Abrahamic religious perspective, which establishes that life's purpose is the fulfillment of God's commandments. 33  This is what gives meaning to people's lives. To live the life of the absurd means rejecting a life that finds or pursues specific meaning for man's existence since there is nothing to be discovered. According to Albert Camus, the world or the human being is not in itself absurd. The concept only emerges through the juxtaposition of the two; life becomes absurd due to the incompatibility between human beings and the world they inhabit. 33  This view constitutes one of the two interpretations of the absurd in existentialist literature. The second view, first elaborated by S ren Kierkegaard, holds that absurdity is limited to actions and choices of human beings. These are considered absurd since they issue from human freedom, undermining their foundation outside of themselves. 34  The absurd contrasts with the claim that \"bad things don't happen to good people\"; to the world, metaphorically speaking, there is no such thing as a good person or a bad person; what happens happens, and it may just as well happen to a \"good\" person as to a \"bad\" person. 35  Because of the world's absurdity, anything can happen to anyone at any time and a tragic event could plummet someone into direct confrontation with the absurd. Many of the literary works of Kierkegaard, Beckett, Kafka, Dostoevsky, Ionesco, Miguel de Unamuno, Luigi Pirandello, 36  37  38  39  Sartre, Joseph Heller, and Camus contain descriptions of people who encounter the absurdity of the world. It is because of the devastating awareness of meaninglessness that Camus claimed in The Myth of Sisyphus that \"There is only one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.\" Although \"prescriptions\" against the possible deleterious consequences of these kinds of encounters vary, from Kierkegaard's religious \"stage\" to Camus' insistence on persevering in spite of absurdity, the concern with helping people avoid living their lives in ways that put them in the perpetual danger of having everything meaningful break down is common to most existentialist philosophers. The possibility of having everything meaningful break down poses a threat of quietism, which is inherently against the existentialist philosophy. 40  It has been said that the possibility of suicide makes all humans existentialists. The ultimate hero of absurdism lives without meaning and faces suicide without succumbing to it. 41  Facticity edit  Main article: Facticity .mw - parser - output .ambox border:1 px solid  a 2 a 9 b 1;border - left:10 px solid  36 c;background - color: fbfbfb;box - sizing:border - box .mw - parser - output .ambox link .ambox,.mw - parser - output .ambox link style .ambox,.mw - parser - output .ambox link link .ambox,.mw - parser - output .ambox .mw - empty - elt link .ambox,.mw - parser - output .ambox .mw - empty - elt link style .ambox,.mw - parser - output .ambox .mw - empty - elt link link .ambox margin - top: - 1 px html body.mediawiki .mw - parser - output .ambox.mbox - small - left margin:4 px 1 em 4 px 0;overflow:hidden;width:238 px;border - collapse:collapse;font - size:88 ;line - height:1.25 em .mw - parser - output .ambox - speedy border - left:10 px solid  b 32424;background - color: fee 7 e 6 .mw - parser - output .ambox - delete border - left:10 px solid  b 32424 .mw - parser - output .ambox - content border - left:10 px solid  f 28500 .mw - parser - output .ambox - style border - left:10 px solid  fc 3 .mw - parser - output .ambox - move border - left:10 px solid  9932 cc .mw - parser - output .ambox - protection border - left:10 px solid  a 2 a 9 b 1 .mw - parser - output .ambox .mbox - text border:none;padding:0.25 em 0.5 em;width:100  .mw - parser - output .ambox .mbox - image border:none;padding:2 px 0 2 px 0.5 em;text - align:center .mw - parser - output .ambox .mbox - imageright border:none;padding:2 px 0.5 em 2 px 0;text - align:center .mw - parser - output .ambox .mbox - empty - cell border:none;padding:0;width:1 px .mw - parser - output .ambox .mbox - image - div width:52 px  media(min - width:720 px) .mw - parser - output .ambox margin:0 10    media print body.ns - 0 .mw - parser - output .ambox display:none!important  This section may be too technical for most readers to understand. Please help improve it to make it understandable to non - experts, without removing the technical details. (November 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Facticity is defined by Sartre in Being and Nothingness (1943) as the in - itself, which for humans takes the form of being and not being. It is the facts of one's personal life and as per Heidegger, it is \"the way in which we are thrown into the world.\" This can be more easily understood when considering facticity in relation to a person's past: one's past forms the person who exists in the present. However, to reduce a person to their past would ignore the change a person undergoes in the present and future, while saying that one's past is only what one was, would entirely detach it from the present self. A denial of one's concrete past constitutes an inauthentic lifestyle, and also applies to other kinds of facticity (having a human body with all its limitations, identity, values, etc.). 42  Facticity is a limitation and a condition of freedom. It is a limitation in that a large part of a person's facticity consists of things they did not choose (birthplace, etc.), but a condition of freedom in the sense that one's values most likely depend on these factors. However, even though one's facticity is fixed, it cannot determine a person: they may choose to assign as much value to their facticity as they choose. As an example, consider two men, one of whom has no memory of his past and the other who remembers everything. Both have committed many crimes, but the first man, remembering nothing, leads a rather normal life while the second man, feeling trapped by his past, continues a life of crime, blaming his own past. There is nothing essential about his committing crimes, but he ascribes this meaning to his past. However, to disregard one's facticity during the evolution of one's sense of self would be a denial of the conditions shaping the present self and would be inauthentic. An example of the focus solely on possible projects without reflecting on one's current facticity would be continually thinking about future possibilities related to being rich (e.g. a better car, bigger house, better quality of life, etc.) without acknowledging the facticity of not currently having the financial means to do so. In this example, considering both facticity and transcendence, an authentic mode of being would be considering future projects that might improve one's current finances (e.g. putting in extra hours, or investing savings) in order to arrive at a real future, or future - facticity of a modest pay rise, further leading to purchase of an affordable car. Another aspect of facticity is that it entails angst. Freedom \"produces\" angst when limited by facticity and the lack of the possibility of having facticity to \"step in\" and take responsibility for something one has done also produces angst. Another aspect of existential freedom is that one can change one's values. One is responsible for one's values, regardless of society's values. The focus on freedom in existentialism is related to the limits of responsibility one bears, as a result of one's freedom. The relationship between freedom and responsibility is one of interdependency and a clarification of freedom also clarifies that for which one is responsible. 43  44  Authenticity edit  Main article: Authenticity Many noted existentialists consider the theme of authentic existence important. Authenticity involves the idea that one has to \"create oneself\" and live in accordance with this self. For an authentic existence, one should act as oneself, not as \"one's acts\" or as \"one's genes\" or as any other essence requires. The authentic act is one in accordance with one's freedom. A component of freedom is facticity, but not to the degree that this facticity determines one's transcendent choices (one could then blame one's background for making the choice one made  chosen project, from one's transcendence ). Facticity, in relation to authenticity, involves acting on one's actual values when making a choice (instead of, like Kierkegaard's Aesthete, \"choosing\" randomly), so that one takes responsibility for the act instead of choosing either - or without allowing the options to have different values. 45  In contrast, the inauthentic is the denial to live clarification needed  in accordance with one's freedom. This can take many forms, from pretending choices are meaningless or random, convincing oneself that some form of determinism is true, or \"mimicry\" where one acts as \"one should\". citation needed  How one \"should\" act is often determined by an image one has, of how one in such a role (bank manager, lion tamer, sex worker, etc.) acts. In Being and Nothingness, Sartre uses the example of a waiter in \"bad faith\". He merely takes part in the \"act\" of being a typical waiter, albeit very convincingly. 46  This image usually corresponds to a social norm, but this does not mean that all acting in accordance with social norms is inauthentic. The main point is the attitude one takes to one's own freedom and responsibility and the extent to which one acts in accordance with this freedom. 47  The Other and the Look edit  Main article: Other (philosophy) The Other (written with a capital \"O\") is a concept more properly belonging to phenomenology and its account of intersubjectivity. However, it has seen widespread use in existentialist writings, and the conclusions drawn differ slightly from the phenomenological accounts. The Other is the experience of another free subject who inhabits the same world as a person does. In its most basic form, it is this experience of the Other that constitutes intersubjectivity and objectivity. To clarify, when one experiences someone else, and this Other person experiences the world (the same world that a person experiences) only from \"over there\" the world is constituted as objective in that it is something that is \"there\" as identical for both of the subjects; a person experiences the other person as experiencing the same things. This experience of the Other's look is what is termed the Look (sometimes the Gaze). 48  While this experience, in its basic phenomenological sense, constitutes the world as objective and oneself as objectively existing subjectivity (one experiences oneself as seen in the Other's Look in precisely the same way that one experiences the Other as seen by him, as subjectivity), in existentialism, it also acts as a kind of limitation of freedom. This is because the Look tends to objectify what it sees. When one experiences oneself in the Look, one does not experience oneself as nothing (no thing), but as something (some thing). In Sartre's example of a man peeping at someone through a keyhole, the man is entirely caught up in the situation he is in. He is in a pre - reflexive state where his entire consciousness is directed at what goes on in the room. Suddenly, he hears a creaking floorboard behind him and he becomes aware of himself as seen by the Other. He is then filled with shame for he perceives himself as he would perceive someone else doing what he was doing as a Peeping Tom. For Sartre, this phenomenological experience of shame establishes proof for the existence of other minds and defeats the problem of solipsism. For the conscious state of shame to be experienced, one has to become aware of oneself as an object of another look, proving a priori, that other minds exist. 49  The Look is then co - constitutive of one's facticity. Another characteristic feature of the Look is that no Other really needs to have been there: It is possible that the creaking floorboard was simply the movement of an old house; the Look is not some kind of mystical telepathic experience of the actual way the Other sees one (there may have been someone there, but he could have not noticed that person). It is only one's perception of the way another might perceive him. 50  Angst and dread edit  Main article: Angst \"Existential angst\", sometimes called existential dread, anxiety, or anguish, is a term common to many existentialist thinkers. It is generally held to be a negative feeling arising from the experience of human freedom and responsibility. 51  52  The archetypal example is the experience one has when standing on a cliff where one not only fears falling off it, but also dreads the possibility of throwing oneself off. In this experience that \"nothing is holding me back\", one senses the lack of anything that predetermines one to either throw oneself off or to stand still, and one experiences one's own freedom. 53  It can also be seen in relation to the previous point how angst is before nothing, and this is what sets it apart from fear that has an object. While one can take measures to remove an object of fear, for angst no such \"constructive\" measures are possible. The use of the word \"nothing\" in this context relates to the inherent insecurity about the consequences of one's actions and to the fact that, in experiencing freedom as angst, one also realizes that one is fully responsible for these consequences. There is nothing in people (genetically, for instance) that acts in their stead that they can blame if something goes wrong. Therefore, not every choice is perceived as having dreadful possible consequences (and, it can be claimed, human lives would be unbearable if every choice facilitated dread). However, this does not change the fact that freedom remains a condition of every action. Despair edit  Main article: Despair See also: Existential crisis Despair is generally defined as a loss of hope. 54  In existentialism, it is more specifically a loss of hope in reaction to a breakdown in one or more of the defining qualities of one's self or identity. If a person is invested in being a particular thing, such as a bus driver or an upstanding citizen, and then finds their being - thing compromised, they would normally be found in a state of despair a hopeless state. For example, a singer who loses the ability to sing may despair if they have nothing else to fall back on nothing to rely on for their identity. They find themselves unable to be what defined their being. What sets the existentialist notion of despair apart from the conventional definition is that existentialist despair is a state one is in even when they are not overtly in despair. So long as a person's identity depends on qualities that can crumble, they are in perpetual despair and as there is, in Sartrean terms, no human essence found in conventional reality on which to constitute the individual's sense of identity, despair is a universal human condition. As Kierkegaard defines it in Either Or: \"Let each one learn what he can; both of us can learn that a person's unhappiness never lies in his lack of control over external conditions, since this would only make him completely unhappy.\" 55  In Works of Love, he says: When the God - forsaken worldliness of earthly life shuts itself in complacency, the confined air develops poison, the moment gets stuck and stands still, the prospect is lost, a need is felt for a refreshing, enlivening breeze to cleanse the air and dispel the poisonous vapors lest we suffocate in worldliness. ... Lovingly to hope all things is the opposite of despairingly to hope nothing at all. Love hopes all things yet is never put to shame. To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of the good is to hope. To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of evil is to fear. By the decision to choose hope one decides infinitely more than it seems, because it is an eternal decision. S ren Kierkegaard, Works of Love Opposition to positivism and rationalism edit  See also: Positivism and Rationalism Existentialists oppose defining human beings as primarily rational, and, therefore, oppose both positivism and rationalism. Existentialism asserts that people make decisions based on subjective meaning rather than pure rationality. The rejection of reason as the source of meaning is a common theme of existentialist thought, as is the focus on the anxiety and dread that we feel in the face of our own radical free will and our awareness of death. Kierkegaard advocated rationality as a means to interact with the objective world (e.g., in the natural sciences), but when it comes to existential problems, reason is insufficient: \"Human reason has boundaries\". 56  Like Kierkegaard, Sartre saw problems with rationality, calling it a form of \"bad faith\", an attempt by the self to impose structure on a world of phenomena \"the Other\" that is fundamentally irrational and random. According to Sartre, rationality and other forms of bad faith hinder people from finding meaning in freedom. To try to suppress feelings of anxiety and dread, people confine themselves within everyday experience, Sartre asserted, thereby relinquishing their freedom and acquiescing to being possessed in one form or another by \"the Look\" of \"the Other\" (i.e., possessed by another person or at least one's idea of that other person). 57  Religion edit  See also: Atheistic existentialism, Christian existentialism, and Jewish existentialism An existentialist reading of the Bible would demand that the reader recognize that they are an existing subject studying the words more as a recollection of events. This is in contrast to looking at a collection of \"truths\" that are outside and unrelated to the reader, but may develop a sense of reality God. Such a reader is not obligated to follow the commandments as if an external agent is forcing these commandments upon them, but as though they are inside them and guiding them from inside. This is the task Kierkegaard takes up when he asks: \"Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life or the learner who should put it to use?\" 58  Philosophers such as Hans Jonas and Rudolph Bultmann introduced the concept of existentialist demythologization into the field of early Christianity and Christian theology, respectively. 59  Confusion with nihilism edit  See also: Existential nihilism Although nihilism and existentialism are distinct philosophies, they are often confused with one another since both are rooted in the human experience of anguish and confusion that stems from the apparent meaninglessness of a world in which humans are compelled to find or create meaning. 60  A primary cause of confusion is that Friedrich Nietzsche was an important philosopher in both fields. Existentialist philosophers often stress the importance of angst as signifying the absolute lack of any objective ground for action, a move that is often reduced to moral or existential nihilism. A pervasive theme in existentialist philosophy, however, is to persist through encounters with the absurd, as seen in Albert Camus's philosophical essay The Myth of Sisyphus (1942): \"One must imagine Sisyphus happy\". 61  and it is only very rarely that existentialist philosophers dismiss morality or one's self - created meaning: S ren Kierkegaard regained a sort of morality in the religious (although he would not agree that it was ethical; the religious suspends the ethical), and Jean - Paul Sartre's final words in Being and Nothingness (1943): \"All these questions, which refer us to a pure and not an accessory (or impure) reflection, can find their reply only on the ethical plane. We shall devote to them a future work.\" 46  History edit  Precursors edit  Some have argued that existentialism has long been an element of European religious thought, even before the term came into use. William Barrett identified Blaise Pascal and S ren Kierkegaard as two specific examples. 62  Jean Wahl also identified William Shakespeare's Prince Hamlet (\"To be, or not to be\"), Jules Lequier, Thomas Carlyle, and William James as existentialists. According to Wahl, \"the origins of most great philosophies, like those of Plato, Descartes, and Kant, are to be found in existential reflections.\" 63  Precursors to existentialism can also be identified in the works of Iranian Muslim philosopher Mulla Sadra (c. 1571 1635), who would posit that \"existence precedes essence\" becoming the principle expositor of the School of Isfahan, which is described as \"alive and active\". according to whom?  19 th century edit  Kierkegaard and Nietzsche edit  Main article: S ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche Kierkegaard is generally considered to have been the first existentialist philosopher. 5  64  65  He proposed that each individual not reason, society, or religious orthodoxy is solely tasked with giving meaning to life and living it sincerely, or \"authentically\". 66  67  Kierkegaard and Nietzsche were two of the first philosophers considered fundamental to the existentialist movement, though neither used the term \"existentialism\" and it is unclear whether they would have supported the existentialism of the 20 th century. They focused on subjective human experience rather than the objective truths of mathematics and science, which they believed were too detached or observational to truly get at the human experience. Like Pascal, they were interested in people's quiet struggle with the apparent meaninglessness of life and the use of diversion to escape from boredom. Unlike Pascal, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche also considered the role of making free choices, particularly regarding fundamental values and beliefs, and how such choices change the nature and identity of the chooser. 68  Kierkegaard's knight of faith and Nietzsche's  bermensch are representative of people who exhibit freedom, in that they define the nature of their own existence. Nietzsche's idealized individual invents his own values and creates the very terms they excel under. By contrast, Kierkegaard, opposed to the level of abstraction in Hegel, and not nearly as hostile (actually welcoming) to Christianity as Nietzsche, argues through a pseudonym that the objective certainty of religious truths (specifically Christian) is not only impossible, but even founded on logical paradoxes. Yet he continues to imply that a leap of faith is a possible means for an individual to reach a higher stage of existence that transcends and contains both an aesthetic and ethical value of life. Kierkegaard and Nietzsche were also precursors to other intellectual movements, including postmodernism, and various strands of psychotherapy. citation needed  However, Kierkegaard believed that individuals should live in accordance with their thinking. 65  In Twilight of the Idols, Nietzsche's sentiments resonate the idea of \"existence precedes essence.\" He writes, \"no one gives man his qualities -  - neither God, nor society, nor his parents and ancestors, nor he himself... No one is responsible for man's being there at all, for his being such - and - such, or for his being in these circumstances or in this environment... Man is not the effect of some special purpose of a will, and end...\" 69  Within this view, Nietzsche ties in his rejection of the existence of God, which he sees as a means to \"redeem the world.\" By rejecting the existence of God, Nietzsche also rejects beliefs that claim humans have a predestined purpose according to what God has instructed. Dostoyevsky edit  The first important literary author also important to existentialism was the Russian, Dostoyevsky. 70  Dostoyevsky's Notes from Underground portrays a man unable to fit into society and unhappy with the identities he creates for himself. Sartre, in his book on existentialism Existentialism is a Humanism, quoted Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov as an example of existential crisis. Other Dostoyevsky novels covered issues raised in existentialist philosophy while presenting story lines divergent from secular existentialism: for example, in Crime and Punishment, the protagonist Raskolnikov experiences an existential crisis and then moves toward a Christian Orthodox worldview similar to that advocated by Dostoyevsky himself. 71  Early 20 th century edit  See also: Martin Heidegger In the first decades of the 20 th century, a number of philosophers and writers explored existentialist ideas. The Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo, in his 1913 book The Tragic Sense of Life in Men and Nations, emphasized the life of \"flesh and bone\" as opposed to that of abstract rationalism. Unamuno rejected systematic philosophy in favor of the individual's quest for faith. He retained a sense of the tragic, even absurd nature of the quest, symbolized by his enduring interest in the eponymous character from the Miguel de Cervantes novel Don Quixote. A novelist, poet and dramatist as well as philosophy professor at the University of Salamanca, Unamuno wrote a short story about a priest's crisis of faith, Saint Manuel the Good, Martyr, which has been collected in anthologies of existentialist fiction. Another Spanish thinker, Jos  Ortega y Gasset, writing in 1914, held that human existence must always be defined as the individual person combined with the concrete circumstances of his life: \"Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia\" (\"I am myself and my circumstances\"). Sartre likewise believed that human existence is not an abstract matter, but is always situated (\"en situation\"). 72  Although Martin Buber wrote his major philosophical works in German, and studied and taught at the Universities of Berlin and Frankfurt, he stands apart from the mainstream of German philosophy. Born into a Jewish family in Vienna in 1878, he was also a scholar of Jewish culture and involved at various times in Zionism and Hasidism. In 1938, he moved permanently to Jerusalem. His best - known philosophical work was the short book I and Thou, published in 1922. 73  For Buber, the fundamental fact of human existence, too readily overlooked by scientific rationalism and abstract philosophical thought, is \"man with man\", a dialogue that takes place in the so - called \"sphere of between\" (\"das Zwischenmenschliche\"). 74  Two Russian philosophers, Lev Shestov and Nikolai Berdyaev, became well known as existentialist thinkers during their post - Revolutionary exiles in Paris. Shestov had launched an attack on rationalism and systematization in philosophy as early as 1905 in his book of aphorisms All Things Are Possible. Berdyaev drew a radical distinction between the world of spirit and the everyday world of objects. Human freedom, for Berdyaev, is rooted in the realm of spirit, a realm independent of scientific notions of causation. To the extent the individual human being lives in the objective world, he is estranged from authentic spiritual freedom. \"Man\" is not to be interpreted naturalistically, but as a being created in God's image, an originator of free, creative acts. 75  He published a major work on these themes, The Destiny of Man, in 1931. Gabriel Marcel, long before coining the term \"existentialism\", introduced important existentialist themes to a French audience in his early essay \"Existence and Objectivity\" (1925) and in his Metaphysical Journal (1927). 76  A dramatist as well as a philosopher, Marcel found his philosophical starting point in a condition of metaphysical alienation: the human individual searching for harmony in a transient life. Harmony, for Marcel, was to be sought through \"secondary reflection\", a \"dialogical\" rather than \"dialectical\" approach to the world, characterized by \"wonder and astonishment\" and open to the \"presence\" of other people and of God rather than merely to \"information\" about them. For Marcel, such presence implied more than simply being there (as one thing might be in the presence of another thing); it connoted \"extravagant\" availability, and the willingness to put oneself at the disposal of the other. 77  Marcel contrasted secondary reflection with abstract, scientific - technical primary reflection, which he associated with the activity of the abstract Cartesian ego. For Marcel, philosophy was a concrete activity undertaken by a sensing, feeling human being incarnate embodied in a concrete world. 76  78  Although Sartre adopted the term \"existentialism\" for his own philosophy in the 1940 s, Marcel's thought has been described as \"almost diametrically opposed\" to that of Sartre. 76  Unlike Sartre, Marcel was a Christian, and became a Catholic convert in 1929. In Germany, the psychiatrist and philosopher Karl Jaspers who later described existentialism as a \"phantom\" created by the public 79  called his own thought, heavily influenced by Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, Existenzphilosophie. For Jaspers, \"Existenz - philosophy is the way of thought by means of which man seeks to become himself... This way of thought does not cognize objects, but elucidates and makes actual the being of the thinker\". 80  Jaspers, a professor at the university of Heidelberg, was acquainted with Heidegger, who held a professorship at Marburg before acceding to Husserl's chair at Freiburg in 1928. They held many philosophical discussions, but later became estranged over Heidegger's support of National Socialism. They shared an admiration for Kierkegaard, 81  and in the 1930 s, Heidegger lectured extensively on Nietzsche. Nevertheless, the extent to which Heidegger should be considered an existentialist is debatable. In Being and Time he presented a method of rooting philosophical explanations in human existence (Dasein) to be analysed in terms of existential categories (existentiale); and this has led many commentators to treat him as an important figure in the existentialist movement. After the Second World War edit  Main article: Feminist existentialism Following the Second World War, existentialism became a well - known and significant philosophical and cultural movement, mainly through the public prominence of two French writers, Jean - Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, who wrote best - selling novels, plays and widely read journalism as well as theoretical texts. 82  These years also saw the growing reputation of Being and Time outside Germany. French philosophers Jean - Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir Sartre dealt with existentialist themes in his 1938 novel Nausea and the short stories in his 1939 collection The Wall, and had published his treatise on existentialism, Being and Nothingness, in 1943, but it was in the two years following the liberation of Paris from the German occupying forces that he and his close associates Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau - Ponty, and others became internationally famous as the leading figures of a movement known as existentialism. 83  In a very short period of time, Camus and Sartre in particular became the leading public intellectuals of post - war France, achieving by the end of 1945 \"a fame that reached across all audiences.\" 84  Camus was an editor of the most popular leftist (former French Resistance) newspaper Combat; Sartre launched his journal of leftist thought, Les Temps Modernes, and two weeks later gave the widely reported lecture on existentialism and secular humanism to a packed meeting of the Club Maintenant. Beauvoir wrote that \"not a week passed without the newspapers discussing us\"; 85  existentialism became \"the first media craze of the postwar era.\" 86  By the end of 1947, Camus' earlier fiction and plays had been reprinted, his new play Caligula had been performed and his novel The Plague published; the first two novels of Sartre's The Roads to Freedom trilogy had appeared, as had Beauvoir's novel The Blood of Others. Works by Camus and Sartre were already appearing in foreign editions. The Paris - based existentialists had become famous. 83  Sartre had traveled to Germany in 1930 to study the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, 87  and he included critical comments on their work in his major treatise Being and Nothingness. Heidegger's thought had also become known in French philosophical circles through its use by Alexandre Koj ve in explicating Hegel in a series of lectures given in Paris in the 1930 s. 88  The lectures were highly influential; members of the audience included not only Sartre and Merleau - Ponty, but Raymond Queneau, Georges Bataille, Louis Althusser, Andr  Breton, and Jacques Lacan. 89  A selection from Being and Time was published in French in 1938, and his essays began to appear in French philosophy journals. French philosopher, novelist, and playwright Albert Camus Heidegger read Sartre's work and was initially impressed, commenting: \"Here for the first time I encountered an independent thinker who, from the foundations up, has experienced the area out of which I think. Your work shows such an immediate comprehension of my philosophy as I have never before encountered.\" 90  Later, however, in response to a question posed by his French follower Jean Beaufret, 91  Heidegger distanced himself from Sartre's position and existentialism in general in his Letter on Humanism. 92  Heidegger's reputation continued to grow in France during the 1950 s and 1960 s. In the 1960 s, Sartre attempted to reconcile existentialism and Marxism in his work Critique of Dialectical Reason. A major theme throughout his writings was freedom and responsibility. Camus was a friend of Sartre, until their falling - out, and wrote several works with existential themes including The Rebel, Summer in Algiers, The Myth of Sisyphus, and The Stranger, the latter being \"considered to what would have been Camus's irritation the exemplary existentialist novel.\" 93  Camus, like many others, rejected the existentialist label, and considered his works concerned with facing the absurd. 94  In the titular book, Camus uses the analogy of the Greek myth of Sisyphus to demonstrate the futility of existence. In the myth, Sisyphus is condemned for eternity to roll a rock up a hill, but when he reaches the summit, the rock will roll to the bottom again. Camus believes that this existence is pointless but that Sisyphus ultimately finds meaning and purpose in his task, simply by continually applying himself to it. The first half of the book contains an extended rebuttal of what Camus took to be existentialist philosophy in the works of Kierkegaard, Shestov, Heidegger, and Jaspers. Simone de Beauvoir, an important existentialist who spent much of her life as Sartre's partner, wrote about feminist existentialist ethics in her works, including The Second Sex and The Ethics of Ambiguity. Although often overlooked due to her relationship with Sartre, 95  de Beauvoir integrated existentialism with other forms of thinking such as feminism, unheard of at the time, resulting in alienation from fellow writers such as Camus. 71  Paul Tillich, an important existentialist theologian following Kierkegaard and Karl Barth, applied existentialist concepts to Christian theology, and helped introduce existential theology to the general public. His seminal work The Courage to Be follows Kierkegaard's analysis of anxiety and life's absurdity, but puts forward the thesis that modern humans must, via God, achieve selfhood in spite of life's absurdity. Rudolf Bultmann used Kierkegaard's and Heidegger's philosophy of existence to demythologize Christianity by interpreting Christian mythical concepts into existentialist concepts. Maurice Merleau - Ponty, an existential phenomenologist, was for a time a companion of Sartre. Merleau - Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception (1945) was recognized as a major statement of French existentialism. 96  It has been said that Merleau - Ponty's work Humanism and Terror greatly influenced Sartre. However, in later years they were to disagree irreparably, dividing many existentialists such as de Beauvoir, 71  who sided with Sartre. Colin Wilson, an English writer, published his study The Outsider in 1956, initially to critical acclaim. In this book and others (e.g. Introduction to the New Existentialism), he attempted to reinvigorate what he perceived as a pessimistic philosophy and bring it to a wider audience. He was not, however, academically trained, and his work was attacked by professional philosophers for lack of rigor and critical standards. 97  Influence outside philosophy edit  Art edit  Film and television edit  Adolphe Menjou (left) and Kirk Douglas (right) in Paths of Glory (1957) Stanley Kubrick's 1957 anti - war film Paths of Glory \"illustrates, and even illuminates...existentialism\" by examining the \"necessary absurdity of the human condition\" and the \"horror of war\". 98  The film tells the story of a fictional World War I French army regiment ordered to attack an impregnable German stronghold; when the attack fails, three soldiers are chosen at random, court - martialed by a \"kangaroo court\", and executed by firing squad. The film examines existentialist ethics, such as the issue of whether objectivity is possible and the \"problem of authenticity\". 98  Orson Welles's 1962 film The Trial, based upon Franz Kafka's book of the same name (Der Proze ), is characteristic of both existentialist and absurdist themes in its depiction of a man (Joseph K.) arrested for a crime for which the charges are neither revealed to him nor to the reader. Neon Genesis Evangelion is a Japanese science fiction animation series created by the anime studio Gainax and was both directed and written by Hideaki Anno. Existential themes of individuality, consciousness, freedom, choice, and responsibility are heavily relied upon throughout the entire series, particularly through the philosophies of Jean - Paul Sartre and S ren Kierkegaard. Episode 16's title, \"The Sickness Unto Death, And...\" (         , Shi ni itaru yamai, soshite) is a reference to Kierkegaard's book, The Sickness Unto Death. Some contemporary films dealing with existentialist issues include Melancholia, Fight Club, I Heart Huckabees, Waking Life, The Matrix, Ordinary People, Life in a Day, Barbie, and Everything Everywhere All at Once. 99  Likewise, films throughout the 20 th century such as The Seventh Seal, Ikiru, Taxi Driver, the Toy Story films, Pok mon: The First Movie, The Great Silence, Ghost in the Shell, Harold and Maude, High Noon, Easy Rider, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, A Clockwork Orange, Groundhog Day, Apocalypse Now, Badlands, and Blade Runner also have existentialist qualities. 100  Notable directors known for their existentialist films include Ingmar Bergman, Bela Tarr, Robert Bresson, Jean - Pierre Melville, Fran ois Truffaut, Jean - Luc Godard, Michelangelo Antonioni, Akira Kurosawa, Terrence Malick, Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky,  ric Rohmer, Wes Anderson, Woody Allen, and Christopher Nolan. 101  Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche, New York focuses on the protagonist's desire to find existential meaning. 102  Similarly, in Kurosawa's Red Beard, the protagonist's experiences as an intern in a rural health clinic in Japan lead him to an existential crisis whereby he questions his reason for being. This, in turn, leads him to a better understanding of humanity. The French film, Mood Indigo (directed by Michel Gondry) embraced various elements of existentialism. citation needed  The film The Shawshank Redemption, released in 1994, depicts life in a prison in Maine, United States to explore several existentialist concepts. 103  Literature edit  First edition of The Trial by Franz Kafka (1925) Existential perspectives are also found in modern literature to varying degrees, especially since the 1920 s. Louis - Ferdinand C line's Journey to the End of the Night (Voyage au bout de la nuit, 1932) celebrated by both Sartre and Beauvoir, contained many of the themes that would be found in later existential literature, and is in some ways, the proto - existential novel. Jean - Paul Sartre's 1938 novel Nausea 104  was \"steeped in Existential ideas\", and is considered an accessible way of grasping his philosophical stance. 105  Between 1900 and 1960, other authors such as Albert Camus, Franz Kafka, Rainer Maria Rilke, T. S. Eliot, Yukio Mishima, Hermann Hesse, Luigi Pirandello, 36  37  39  106  107  108  Ralph Ellison, 109  110  111  112  and Jack Kerouac composed literature or poetry that contained, to varying degrees, elements of existential or proto - existential thought. The philosophy's influence even reached pulp literature shortly after the turn of the 20 th century, as seen in the existential disparity witnessed in Man's lack of control of his fate in the works of H. P. Lovecraft. 113  Theatre edit  Sartre wrote No Exit in 1944, an existentialist play originally published in French as Huis Clos (meaning In Camera or \"behind closed doors\"), which is the source of the popular quote, \"Hell is other people.\" (In French, \"L'enfer, c'est les autres\"). The play begins with a Valet leading a man into a room that the audience soon realizes is in hell. Eventually he is joined by two women. After their entry, the Valet leaves and the door is shut and locked. All three expect to be tortured, but no torturer arrives. Instead, they realize they are there to torture each other, which they do effectively by probing each other's sins, desires, and unpleasant memories. Existentialist themes are displayed in the Theatre of the Absurd, notably in Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, in which two men divert themselves while they wait expectantly for someone (or something) named Godot who never arrives. They claim Godot is an acquaintance, but in fact, hardly know him, admitting they would not recognize him if they saw him. Samuel Beckett, once asked who or what Godot is, replied, \"If I knew, I would have said so in the play.\" To occupy themselves, the men eat, sleep, talk, argue, sing, play games, exercise, swap hats, and contemplate suicide anything \"to hold the terrible silence at bay\". 114  The play \"exploits several archetypal forms and situations, all of which lend themselves to both comedy and pathos.\" 115  The play also illustrates an attitude toward human experience on earth: the poignancy, oppression, camaraderie, hope, corruption, and bewilderment of human experience that can be reconciled only in the mind and art of the absurdist. The play examines questions such as death, the meaning of human existence and the place of God in human existence. Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz   Guildenstern Are Dead is an absurdist tragicomedy first staged at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1966. 116  The play expands upon the exploits of two minor characters from Shakespeare's Hamlet. Comparisons have also been drawn to Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, for the presence of two central characters who appear almost as two halves of a single character. Many plot features are similar as well: the characters pass time by playing Questions, impersonating other characters, and interrupting each other or remaining silent for long periods of time. The two characters are portrayed as two clowns or fools in a world beyond their understanding. They stumble through philosophical arguments while not realizing the implications, and muse on the irrationality and randomness of the world. Jean Anouilh's Antigone also presents arguments founded on existentialist ideas. 117  It is a tragedy inspired by Greek mythology and the play of the same name (Antigone, by Sophocles) from the fifth century BC. In English, it is often distinguished from its antecedent by being pronounced in its original French form, approximately \"Ante - G N.\" The play was first performed in Paris on 6 February 1944, during the Nazi occupation of France. Produced under Nazi censorship, the play is purposefully ambiguous with regards to the rejection of authority (represented by Antigone) and the acceptance of it (represented by Creon). The parallels to the French Resistance and the Nazi occupation have been drawn. Antigone rejects life as desperately meaningless but without affirmatively choosing a noble death. The crux of the play is the lengthy dialogue concerning the nature of power, fate, and choice, during which Antigone says that she is, \"... disgusted with  the ...promise of a humdrum happiness.\" She states that she would rather die than live a mediocre existence. Critic Martin Esslin in his book Theatre of the Absurd pointed out how many contemporary playwrights such as Samuel Beckett, Eug ne Ionesco, Jean Genet, and Arthur Adamov wove into their plays the existentialist belief that we are absurd beings loose in a universe empty of real meaning. Esslin noted that many of these playwrights demonstrated the philosophy better than did the plays by Sartre and Camus. Though most of such playwrights, subsequently labeled \"Absurdist\" (based on Esslin's book), denied affiliations with existentialism and were often staunchly anti - philosophical (for example Ionesco often claimed he identified more with 'Pataphysics or with Surrealism than with existentialism), the playwrights are often linked to existentialism based on Esslin's observation. 118  Activism edit  Black existentialism explores the existence and experiences of Black people in the world. 119  Classical and contemporary thinkers include C. L. R James, Frederick Douglass, W. E. B DuBois, Frantz Fanon, Angela Davis, Cornel West, Naomi Zack, bell hooks, Stuart Hall, Lewis Gordon, and Audre Lorde. 120  Psychoanalysis and psychotherapy edit  Main article: Existential therapy A major offshoot of existentialism as a philosophy is existentialist psychology and psychoanalysis, which first crystallized in the work of Otto Rank, Freud's closest associate for 20 years. Without awareness of the writings of Rank, Ludwig Binswanger was influenced by Freud, Edmund Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre. A later figure was Viktor Frankl, who briefly met Freud as a young man. 121  His logotherapy can be regarded as a form of existentialist therapy. The existentialists would also influence social psychology, antipositivist micro - sociology, symbolic interactionism, and post - structuralism, with the work of thinkers such as Georg Simmel 122  and Michel Foucault. Foucault was a great reader of Kierkegaard even though he almost never refers to this author, who nonetheless had for him an importance as secret as it was decisive. 123  An early contributor to existentialist psychology in the United States was Rollo May, who was strongly influenced by Kierkegaard and Otto Rank. One of the most prolific writers on techniques and theory of existentialist psychology in the US is Irvin D. Yalom. Yalom states that Aside from their reaction against Freud's mechanistic, deterministic model of the mind and their assumption of a phenomenological approach in therapy, the existentialist analysts have little in common and have never been regarded as a cohesive ideological school. These thinkers who include Ludwig Binswanger, Medard Boss, Eug ne Minkowski, V. E. Gebsattel, Roland Kuhn, G. Caruso, F. T. Buytendijk, G. Bally, and Victor Frankl were almost entirely unknown to the American psychotherapeutic community until Rollo May's highly influential 1958 book Existence and especially his introductory essay introduced their work into this country. 124  A more recent contributor to the development of a European version of existentialist psychotherapy is the British - based Emmy van Deurzen. 125 : 142 144 Anxiety's importance in existentialism makes it a popular topic in psychotherapy. Therapists often offer existentialist philosophy as an explanation for anxiety. The assertion is that anxiety is manifested of an individual's complete freedom to decide, and complete responsibility for the outcome of such decisions. Psychotherapists using an existentialist approach believe that a patient can harness his anxiety and use it constructively. Instead of suppressing anxiety, patients are advised to use it as grounds for change. By embracing anxiety as inevitable, a person can use it to achieve his full potential in life. Humanistic psychology also had major impetus from existentialist psychology and shares many of the fundamental tenets. Terror management theory, based on the writings of Ernest Becker and Otto Rank, is a developing area of study within the academic study of psychology. It looks at what researchers claim are implicit emotional reactions of people confronted with the knowledge that they will eventually die. 126  Also, Gerd B. Achenbach has refreshed the Socratic tradition with his own blend of philosophical counseling; as did Michel Weber with his Chromatiques Center in Belgium. citation needed  Criticisms edit  General criticisms edit  Walter Kaufmann criticized \"the profoundly unsound methods and the dangerous contempt for reason that have been so prominent in existentialism.\" 127  Logical positivist philosophers, such as Rudolf Carnap and A. J. Ayer, assert that existentialists are often confused about the verb \"to be\" in their analyses of \"being\". 128  Specifically, they argue that the verb \"is\" is transitive and pre - fixed to a predicate (e.g., an apple is red) (without a predicate, the word \"is\" is meaningless), and that existentialists frequently misuse the term in this manner. Colin Wilson has stated in his book The Angry Years that existentialism has created many of its own difficulties: \"We can see how this question of freedom of the will has been vitiated by post - romantic philosophy, with its inbuilt tendency to laziness and boredom, we can also see how it came about that existentialism found itself in a hole of its own digging, and how the philosophical developments since then have amounted to walking in circles round that hole.\" 129  Sartre's philosophy edit  Many critics argue Sartre's philosophy is contradictory. Specifically, they argue that Sartre makes metaphysical arguments despite his claiming that his philosophical views ignore metaphysics. Herbert Marcuse criticized Being and Nothingness for projecting anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself: \"Insofar as Existentialism is a philosophical doctrine, it remains an idealistic doctrine: it hypostatizes specific historical conditions of human existence into ontological and metaphysical characteristics. Existentialism thus becomes part of the very ideology which it attacks, and its radicalism is illusory.\" 130  In Letter on Humanism, Heidegger criticized Sartre's existentialism: Existentialism says existence precedes essence. In this statement he is taking existentia and essentia according to their metaphysical meaning, which, from Plato's time on, has said that essentia precedes existentia. Sartre reverses this statement. But the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement. With it, he stays with metaphysics, in oblivion of the truth of Being. 131  See also edit  .mw - parser - output .div - col margin - top:0.3 em;column - width:30 em .mw - parser - output .div - col - small font - size:90  .mw - parser - output .div - col - rules column - rule:1 px solid  aaa .mw - parser - output .div - col dl,.mw - parser - output .div - col ol,.mw - parser - output .div - col ul margin - top:0 .mw - parser - output .div - col li,.mw - parser - output .div - col dd page - break - inside:avoid;break - inside:avoid - column  Abandonment (existentialism) Disenchantment Existential phenomenology Existential risk Existentiell List of existentialists Meaning (existential) Meaning - making Philosophical pessimism Self - reflection References edit  Citations edit  .mw - parser - output .reflist margin - bottom:0.5 em;list - style - type:decimal  media screen .mw - parser - output .reflist font - size:90   .mw - parser - output .reflist .references font - size:100 ;margin - bottom:0;list - style - type:inherit .mw - parser - output .reflist - columns - 2 column - width:30 em .mw - parser - output .reflist - columns - 3 column - width:25 em .mw - parser - output .reflist - columns margin - top:0.3 em .mw - parser - output .reflist - columns ol margin - top:0 .mw - parser - output .reflist - columns li page - break - inside:avoid;break - inside:avoid - column .mw - parser - output .reflist - upper - alpha list - style - type:upper - alpha .mw - parser - output .reflist - upper - roman list - style - type:upper - roman .mw - parser - output .reflist - lower - alpha list - style - type:lower - alpha .mw - parser - output .reflist - lower - greek list - style - type:lower - greek .mw - parser - output .reflist - lower - roman list - style - type:lower - roman    .mw - parser - output cite.citation font - style:inherit;word - wrap:break - word .mw - parser - output .citation q quotes:\" \"\"\" \"\"\"'\"\"'\" .mw - parser - output .citation:target background - color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133) .mw - parser - output .id - lock - free.id - lock - free a background:url(\"  upload.wikimedia.org wikipedia commons 6 65 Lock - green.svg\")right 0.1 em center 9 px no - repeat .mw - parser - output .id - lock - limited.id - lock - limited a,.mw - parser - output .id - lock - registration.id - lock - registration a background:url(\"  upload.wikimedia.org wikipedia commons d d 6 Lock - gray - alt - 2.svg\")right 0.1 em center 9 px no - repeat .mw - parser - output .id - lock - subscription.id - lock - subscription a background:url(\"  upload.wikimedia.org wikipedia commons a aa Lock - red - alt - 2.svg\")right 0.1 em center 9 px no - repeat .mw - parser - output .cs 1 - ws - icon a background:url(\"  upload.wikimedia.org wikipedia commons 4 4 c Wikisource - logo.svg\")right 0.1 em center 12 px no - repeat body:not(.skin - timeless):not(.skin - minerva) .mw - parser - output .id - lock - free a,body:not(.skin - timeless):not(.skin - minerva) .mw - parser - output .id - lock - limited a,body:not(.skin - timeless):not(.skin - minerva) .mw - parser - output .id - lock - registration a,body:not(.skin - timeless):not(.skin - minerva) .mw - parser - output .id - lock - subscription a,body:not(.skin - timeless):not(.skin - minerva) .mw - parser - output .cs 1 - ws - icon a background - size:contain;padding:0 1 em 0 0 .mw - parser - output .cs 1 - code color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit .mw - parser - output .cs 1 - hidden - error display:none;color:var( -  - color - error, d 33) .mw - parser - output .cs 1 - visible - error color:var( -  - color - error, d 33) .mw - parser - output .cs 1 - maint display:none;color: 085;margin - left:0.3 em .mw - parser - output .cs 1 - kern - left padding - left:0.2 em .mw - parser - output .cs 1 - kern - right padding - right:0.2 em .mw - parser - output .citation .mw - selflink font - weight:inherit  media screen .mw - parser - output .cs 1 - format font - size:95  html.skin - theme - clientpref - night .mw - parser - output .cs 1 - maint color: 18911 f   media screen and (prefers - color - scheme:dark) html.skin - theme - clientpref - os .mw - parser - output .cs 1 - maint color: 18911 f  \"existentialism\".

    "ai_overview": "Existentialist theories address the understanding of life's meaning by emphasizing:\n* **Concrete, first-person experience:** Existentialism stresses analyzing the particulars of everyday life, including feelings, relationships, and commitments.\n* **Engagement vs. detachment:** It prioritizes a situated, first-person experience rather than detached, objective theorizing.\n* **Subjective truth:** Existentialism values individual subjective truth over objective knowledge, emphasizing truths \"which are true for me\".\n* **Freedom and responsibility:** It recognizes that individuals are free and responsible for their choices and actions.\n* **Self-creation through action:** Existence is understood as a dynamic process of self-making through choices and actions.\n* **Authenticity:** The concept of breaking with tradition and social convention to affirm the freedom of one's own condition.\n* **Rejection of pre-given essence:** Existentialism posits that there is no pre-given or essential nature that determines individuals.\n* **Critique of mass society:** It critiques conformity to societal norms, advocating for individuals to live authentically and make their own choices.\n* **Ethics based on freedom:** Existentialism acknowledges freedom, transcendence, and the responsibility to help others realize their own freedom.\n* **Anxiety and meaninglessness:** The acknowledgement of there is no overarching reason, order, or purpose to existence.",

    "content": "Existentialism Existentialism is a catch - all term for those philosophers who consider the nature of the human condition as a key philosophical problem and who share the view that this problem is best addressed through ontology. This very broad definition will be clarified by discussing seven key themes that existentialist thinkers address. Those philosophers considered existentialists are mostly from the continent of Europe, and date from the 19 th and 20 th centuries. Outside philosophy, the existentialist movement is probably the most well - known philosophical movement, and at least two of its members are among the most famous philosophical personalities and widely read philosophical authors. It has certainly had considerable influence outside philosophy, for example on psychological theory and on the arts. Within philosophy, though, it is safe to say that this loose movement considered as a whole has not had a great impact, although individuals or ideas counted within it remain important. Moreover, most of the philosophers conventionally grouped under this heading either never used, or actively disavowed, the term  existentialist . Even Sartre himself once said:  Existentialism? I don t know what that is. So, there is a case to be made that the term   insofar as it leads us to ignore what is distinctive about philosophical positions and to conflate together significantly different ideas   does more harm than good. In this article, however, it is assumed that something sensible can be said about existentialism as a loosely defined movement. The article has three sections. First, we outline a set of themes that define, albeit very broadly, existentialist concerns. This is done with reference to the historical context of existentialism, which will help us to understand why certain philosophical problems and methods were considered so important. Second, we discuss individually six philosophers who are arguably its central figures, stressing in these discussions the ways in which these philosophers approached existentialist themes in distinctive ways. These figures, and many of the others we mention, have full length articles of their own within the Encyclopedia. Finally, we look very briefly at the influence of existentialism, especially outside philosophy.

Key Themes of Existentialism Although a highly diverse tradition of thought, seven themes can be identified that provide some sense of overall unity. Here, these themes will be briefly introduced; they can then provide us with an intellectual framework within which to discuss exemplary figures within the history of existentialism. a. Philosophy as a Way of Life Philosophy should not be thought of primarily either as an attempt to investigate and understand the self or the world, or as a special occupation that concerns only a few. Rather, philosophy must be thought of as fully integrated within life. To be sure, there may need to be professional philosophers, who develop an elaborate set of methods and concepts (Sartre makes this point frequently) but life can be lived philosophically without a technical knowledge of philosophy. Existentialist thinkers tended to identify two historical antecedents for this notion. First, the ancient Greeks, and particularly the figure of Socrates but also the Stoics and Epicureans. Socrates was not only non - professional, but in his pursuit of the good life he tended to eschew the formation of a  system  or  theory , and his teachings took place often in public spaces. In this, the existentialists were hardly unusual. In the 19 th and 20 th centuries, the rapid expansion of industrialisation and advance in technology were often seen in terms of an alienation of the human from nature or from a properly natural way of living (for example, thinkers of German and English romanticism). The second influence on thinking of philosophy as a way of life was German Idealism after Kant. Partly as a response to the 18 th century Enlightenment, and under the influence of the Neoplatonists, Schelling and Hegel both thought of philosophy as an activity that is an integral part of the history of human beings, rather than outside of life and the world, looking on. Later in the 19 th century, Marx famously criticised previous philosophy by saying that the point of philosophy is not to know things   even to know things about activity   but to change them. The concept of philosophy as a way of life manifests itself in existentialist thought in a number of ways. Let us give several examples, to which we will return in the sections that follow. First, the existentialists often undertook a critique of modern life in terms of the specialisation of both manual and intellectual labour. Specialisation included philosophy. One consequence of this is that many existentialist thinkers experimented with different styles or genres of writing in order to escape the effects of this specialisation. Second, a notion that we can call  immanence : philosophy studies life from the inside. For Kierkegaard, for example, the fundamental truths of my existence are not representations   not, that is, ideas, propositions or symbols the meaning of which can be separated from their origin. Rather, the truths of existence are immediately lived, felt and acted. Likewise, for Nietzsche and Heidegger, it is essential to recognise that the philosopher investigating human existence is, him or herself, an existing human. Third, the nature of life itself is a perennial existentialist concern and, more famously (in Heidegger and in Camus), also the significance of death. b. Anxiety and Authenticity A key idea here is that human existence is in some way  on its own ; anxiety (or anguish) is the recognition of this fact. Anxiety here has two important implications. First, most generally, many existentialists tended to stress the significance of emotions or feelings, in so far as they were presumed to have a less culturally or intellectually mediated relation to one s individual and separate existence. This idea is found in Kierkegaard, as we mentioned above, and in Heidegger s discussion of  mood ; it is also one reason why existentialism had an influence on psychology. Second, anxiety also stands for a form of existence that is recognition of being on its own. What is meant by  being on its own  varies among philosophers. For example, it might mean the irrelevance (or even negative influence) of rational thought, moral values, or empirical evidence, when it comes to making fundamental decisions concerning one s existence. As we shall see, Kierkegaard sees Hegel s account of religion in terms of the history of absolute spirit as an exemplary confusion of faith and reason. Alternatively, it might be a more specifically theological claim: the existence of a transcendent deity is not relevant to (or is positively detrimental to) such decisions (a view broadly shared by Nietzsche and Sartre). Finally, being on its own might signify the uniqueness of human existence, and thus the fact that it cannot understand itself in terms of other kinds of existence (Heidegger and Sartre). Related to anxiety is the concept of authenticity, which is let us say the existentialist spin on the Greek notion of  the good life . As we shall see, the authentic being would be able to recognise and affirm the nature of existence (we shall shortly specify some of the aspects of this, such as absurdity and freedom). Not, though, recognise the nature of existence as an intellectual fact, disengaged from life; but rather, the authentic being lives in accordance with this nature. The notion of authenticity is sometimes seen as connected to individualism. This is only reinforced by the contrast with a theme we will discuss below, that of the  crowd . Certainly, if authenticity involves  being on one s own , then there would seem to be some kind of value in celebrating and sustaining one s difference and independence from others. However, many existentialists see individualism as a historical and cultural trend (for example Nietzsche), or dubious political value (Camus), rather than a necessary component of authentic existence. Individualism tends to obscure the particular types of collectivity that various existentialists deem important. For many existentialists, the conditions of the modern world make authenticity especially difficult. For example, many existentialists would join other philosophers (such as the Frankfurt School) in condemning an instrumentalist conception of reason and value. The utilitarianism of Mill measured moral value and justice also in terms of the consequences of actions. Later liberalism would seek to absorb nearly all functions of political and social life under the heading of economic performance. Evaluating solely in terms of the measurable outcomes of production was seen as reinforcing the secularisation of the institutions of political, social or economic life; and reinforcing also the abandonment of any broader sense of the spiritual dimension (such an idea is found acutely in Emerson, and is akin to the concerns of Kierkegaard). Existentialists such as Martin Heidegger, Hanna Arendt or Gabriel Marcel viewed these social movements in terms of a narrowing of the possibilities of human thought to the instrumental or technological. This narrowing involved thinking of the world in terms of resources, and thinking of all human action as a making, or indeed as a machine - like  function . c. Freedom The next key theme is freedom. Freedom can usefully be linked to the concept of anguish, because my freedom is in part defined by the isolation of my decisions from any determination by a deity, or by previously existent values or knowledge. Many existentialists identified the 19 th and 20 th centuries as experiencing a crisis of values. This might be traced back to familiar reasons such as an increasingly secular society, or the rise of scientific or philosophical movements that questioned traditional accounts of value (for example Marxism or Darwinism), or the shattering experience of two world wars and the phenomenon of mass genocide. It is important to note, however, that for existentialism these historical conditions do not create the problem of anguish in the face of freedom, but merely cast it into higher relief. Likewise, freedom entails something like responsibility, for myself and for my actions. Given that my situation is one of being on its own   recognised in anxiety   then both my freedom and my responsibility are absolute. The isolation that we discussed above means that there is nothing else that acts through me, or that shoulders my responsibility. Likewise, unless human existence is to be understood as arbitrarily changing moment to moment, this freedom and responsibility must stretch across time. Thus, when I exist as an authentically free being, I assume responsibility for my whole life, for a  project  or a  commitment . We should note here that many of the existentialists take on a broadly Kantian notion of freedom: freedom as autonomy. This means that freedom, rather than being randomness or arbitrariness, consists in the binding of oneself to a law, but a law that is given by the self in recognition of its responsibilities. This borrowing from Kant, however, is heavily qualified by the next theme. d. Situatedness The next common theme we shall call  situatedness . Although my freedom is absolute, it always takes place in a particular context. My body and its characteristics, my circumstances in a historical world, and my past, all weigh upon freedom. This is what makes freedom meaningful. Suppose I tried to exist as free, while pretending to be in abstraction from the situation. In that case I will have no idea what possibilities are open to me and what choices need to be made, here and now. In such a case, my freedom will be na ve or illusory. This concrete notion of freedom has its philosophical genesis in Hegel, and is generally contrasted to the pure rational freedom described by Kant. Situatedness is related to a notion we discussed above under the heading of philosophy as a way of life: the necessity of viewing or understanding life and existence from the  inside . For example, many 19 th century intellectuals were interested in ancient Greece, Rome, the Medieval period, or the orient, as alternative models of a less spoiled, more integrated form of life. Nietzsche, to be sure, shared these interests, but he did so not uncritically: because the human condition is characterised by being historically situated, it cannot simply turn back the clock or decide all at once to be other than it is (Sartre especially shares this view). Heidegger expresses a related point in this way: human existence cannot be abstracted from its world because being - in - the - world is part of the ontological structure of that existence. Many existentialists take my concretely individual body, and the specific type of life that my body lives, as a primary fact about me (for example, Nietzsche, Scheler or Merleau - Ponty). I must also be situated socially: each of my acts says something about how I view others but, reciprocally, each of their acts is a view about what I am. My freedom is always situated with respect to the judgements of others. This particular notion comes from Hegel s analysis of  recognition , and is found especially in Sartre, de Beauvoir and Jaspers. Situatedness in general also has an important philosophical antecedent in Marx: economic and political conditions are not contingent features with respect to universal human nature, but condition that nature from the ground up. e. Existence Although, of course, existentialism takes its name from the philosophical theme of  existence , this does not entail that there is homogeneity in the manner existence is to be understood. One point on which there is agreement, though, is that the existence with which we should be concerned here is not just any existent thing, but human existence. There is thus an important difference between distinctively human existence and anything else, and human existence is not to be understood on the model of things, that is, as objects of knowledge. One might think that this is an old idea, rooted in Plato s distinction between matter and soul, or Descartes  between extended and thinking things. But these distinctions appear to be just differences between two types of things. Descartes in particular, however, is often criticised by the existentialists for subsuming both under the heading  substance , and thus treating what is distinctive in human existence as indeed a thing or object, albeit one with different properties. (Whether the existentialist characterisation of Plato or Descartes is accurate is a different question.) The existentialists thus countered the Platonic or Cartesian conception with a model that resembles more the Aristotelian as developed in the Nichomachean Ethics. The latter idea arrives in existentialist thought filtered through Leibniz and Spinoza and the notion of a striving for existence. Equally important is the elevation of the practical above the theoretical in German Idealists. Particularly in Kant, who stressed the primacy of the  practical , and then in Fichte and early Schelling, we find the notion that human existence is action. Accordingly, in Nietzsche and Sartre we find the notion that the human being is all and only what that being does. My existence consists of forever bringing myself into being   and, correlatively, fleeing from the dead, inert thing that is the totality of my past actions. Although my acts are free, I am not free not to act; thus existence is characterised also by  exigency  (Marcel). For many existentialists, authentic existence involves a certain tension be recognised and lived through, but not resolved: this tension might be between the animal and the rational (important in Nietzsche) or between facticity and transcendence (Sartre and de Beauvoir). In the 19 th and 20 th centuries, the human sciences (such as psychology, sociology or economics) were coming to be recognised as powerful and legitimate sciences. To some extend at least their assumptions and methods seemed to be borrowed from the natural sciences. While philosophers such as Dilthey and later Gadamer were concerned to show that the human sciences had to have a distinctive method, the existentialists were inclined to go further. The free, situated human being is not an object of knowledge in the sense the human always exists as the possibility of transcending any knowledge of it. There is a clear relation between such an idea and the notion of the  transcendence of the other  found in the ethical phenomenology of Emmanuel Levinas. f. Irrationality Absurdity Among the most famous ideas associated with existentialism is that of  absurdity . Human existence might be described as  absurd  in one of the following senses. First, many existentialists argued that nature as a whole has no design, no reason for existing. Although the natural world can apparently be understood by physical science or metaphysics, this might be better thought of as  description  than either understanding or explanation. Thus, the achievements of the natural sciences also empty nature of value and meaning. Unlike a created cosmos, for example, we cannot expect the scientifically described cosmos to answer our questions concerning value or meaning. Moreover, such description comes at the cost of a profound falsification of nature: namely, the positing of ideal entities such as  laws of nature , or the conflation of all reality under a single model of being. Human beings can and should become profoundly aware of this lack of reason and the impossibility of an immanent understanding of it. Camus, for example, argues that the basic scene of human existence is its confrontation with this mute irrationality. A second meaning of the absurd is this: my freedom will not only be undetermined by knowledge or reason, but from the point of view of the latter my freedom will even appear absurd. Absurdity is thus closely related to the theme of  being on its own , which we discussed above under the heading of anxiety. Even if I choose to follow a law that I have given myself, my choice of law will appear absurd, and likewise will my continuously reaffirmed choice to follow it. Third, human existence as action is doomed to always destroy itself. A free action, once done, is no longer free; it has become an aspect of the world, a thing. The absurdity of human existence then seems to lie in the fact that in becoming myself (a free existence) I must be what I am not (a thing). If I do not face up to this absurdity, and choose to be or pretend to be thing - like, I exist inauthentically (the terms in this formulation are Sartre s). g. The Crowd Existentialism generally also carries a social or political dimension. Insofar as he or she is authentic, the freedom of the human being will show a certain  resolution  or  commitment , and this will involve also the being   and particularly the authentic being   of others. For example, Nietzsche thus speaks of his (or Zarathustra s) work in aiding the transformation of the human, and there is also in Nietzsche a striking analysis of the concept of friendship; for Heidegger, there must be an authentic mode of being - with others, although he does not develop this idea at length; the social and political aspect of authentic commitment is much more clear in Sartre, de Beauvoir and Camus. That is the positive side of the social or political dimension. However, leading up to this positive side, there is a description of the typical forms that inauthentic social or political existence takes. Many existentialists employ terms such as  crowd ,  horde  (Scheler) or the  masses  (Jos  Ortega y Gasset). Nietzsche s deliberately provocative expression,  the herd , portrays the bulk of humanity not only as animal, but as docile and domesticated animals. Notice that these are all collective terms: inauthenticity manifests itself as de - individuated or faceless. Instead of being formed authentically in freedom and anxiety, values are just accepted from others because  that is what everybody does . These terms often carry a definite historical resonance, embodying a critique of specifically modern modes of human existence. All of the following might be seen as either causes or symptoms of a world that is  fallen  or  broken  (Marcel): the technology of mass communication (Nietzsche is particularly scathing about newspapers and journalists; in Two Ages, Kierkegaard says something very similar), empty religious observances, the specialisation of labour and social roles, urbanisation and industrialisation. The theme of the crowd poses a question also to the positive social or political dimension of existentialism: how could a collective form of existence ever be anything other than inauthentic? The 19 th and 20 th century presented a number of mass political ideologies which might be seen as posing a particularly challenging environment for authentic and free existence. For example, nationalism came in for criticism particularly by Nietzsche. Socialism and communism: after WWII, Sartre was certainly a communist, but even then unafraid to criticise both the French communist party and the Soviet Union for rigid or inadequately revolutionary thinking. Democracy: Aristotle in book 5 of his Politics distinguishes between democracy and ochlocracy, which latter essentially means rule by those incapable of ruling even themselves. Many existentialists would identify the latter with the American and especially French concept of  democracy . Nietzsche and Ortega y Gasset both espoused a broadly aristocratic criterion for social and political leadership. 2. Key Existentialist Philosophers a. S ren Kierkegaard (1813 - 1855) as an Existentialist Philosopher Kierkegaard was many things: philosopher, religious writer, satirist, psychologist, journalist, literary critic and generally considered the  father  of existentialism. Being born (in Copenhagen) to a wealthy family enabled him to devote his life to the pursuits of his intellectual interests as well as to distancing himself from the  everyday man  of his times. Kierkegaard s most important works are pseudonymous, written under fictional names, often very obviously fictional. The issue of pseudonymity has been variously interpreted as a literary device, a personal quirk or as an illustration of the constant tension between the philosophical truth and existential or personal truth. We have already seen that for the existentialists it is of equal importance what one says and the way in which something is said. This forms part of the attempt to return to a more authentic way of philosophising, firstly exemplified by the Greeks. In a work like Either Or (primarily a treatise against the Hegelians) theoretical reflections are followed by reflections on how to seduce girls. The point is to stress the distance between the anonymously and logically produced truths of the logicians and the personal truths of existing individuals. Every pseudonymous author is a symbol for an existing individual and at times his very name is the key to the mysteries of his existence (like in the case of Johanes de Silentio, fictional author of Fear and Trembling, where the mystery of Abraham s actions cannot be told, being a product of and belonging to silence). Kierkegaard has been associated with a notion of truth as subjective (or personal); but what does this mean? The issue is linked with his notorious confrontation with the Danish Church and the academic environment of his days. Kierkegaard s work takes place against the background of an academia dominated by Hegelian dialectics and a society which reduces the communication with the divine to the everyday observance of the ritualistic side of an institutionalized Christianity. Hegel is for Kierkegaard his arch - enemy not only because of what he writes but also what he represents. Hegel is guilty for Kierkegaard because he reduced the living truth of Christianity (the fact that God suffered and died on the Cross) to just another moment, which necessarily will be overcome, in the dialectical development of the Spirit. While Hegel treats  God  as a Begriff (a concept), for Kierkegaard the truth of Christianity signifies the very paradoxicality of faith: that is, that it is possible for the individual to go beyond the  ethical  and nevertheless or rather because of this very act of disobedience to be loved by  God . Famously, for Hegel  all that is real is rational    where rationality means the historically articulated, dialectical progression of Spirit   whereas for Kierkegaard the suspension of rationality is the very secret of Christianity. Against the cold logic of the Hegelian system Kierkegaard seeks  a truth which is truth for me  (Kierkegaard 1996:32). Christianity in particular represents the attempt to offer one s life to the service of the divine. This cannot be argued, it can only be lived. While a theologian will try to argue for the validity of his positions by arguing and counter - arguing, a true Christian will try to live his life the way Jesus lived it. This evidently marks the continuation of the Hellenic idea of philosophy as a way of life, exemplified in the person of Socrates who did not write treatises, but who died for his ideas. Before the logical concepts of the theologians (in the words of Martin Heidegger who was hugely influenced by Kierkegaard)  man can neither fall to his knees in awe nor can he play music and dance before this god  (Heidegger 2002:42). The idea of  subjective truth  will have serious consequences to the philosophical understanding of man. Traditionally defined as animale rationale (the rational animal) by Aristotle and for a long time worshiped as such by generations of philosophical minds, Kierkegaard comes now to redefine the human as the  passionate animal . What counts in man is the intensity of his emotions and his willingness to believe (contra the once all powerful reason) in that which cannot be understood. The opening up by Kierkegaard of this terra incognita of man s inner life will come to play a major role for later existentialists (most importantly for Nietzsche) and will bring to light the failings and the weaknesses of an over - optimistic (because modelled after the Natural sciences) model of philosophy which was taught to talk a lot concerning the  truth  of the human, when all it understood about the human was a mutilated version. In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve lived in a state of innocence in communication with God and in harmony with their physical environment. The expulsion from the Garden opened up a wide range of new possibilities for them and thus the problem of anxiety arose. Adam (the Hebrew word for man) is now free to determine through his actions the route of things. Naturally, there is a tension here. The human, created in God s image, is an infinite being. Like God he also can choose and act according to his will. Simultaneously, though, he is a finite being since he is restricted by his body, particular socioeconomic conditions and so forth. This tension between the finite and infinite is the source of anxiety. But unlike a Hegelian analysis, Kierkegaard does not look for a way out from anxiety; on the contrary he stresses its positive role in the flourishing of the human. As he characteristically puts it:  Because he is a synthesis, he can be in anxiety; and the more profoundly he is in anxiety, the greater is the man  (Kierkegaard 1980:154). The prioritization of anxiety as a fundamental trait of the human being is a typical existentialist move, eager to assert the positive role of emotions for human life. Perhaps the most famous work of Kierkegaard was Fear and Trembling, a short book which exhibits many of the issues raised by him throughout his career. Fear and Trembling retells the story of the attempted sacrifice of Isaac by his father Abraham. God tells Abraham that in order to prove his faith he has to sacrifice his only son. Abraham obeys, but at the last moment God intervenes and saves Isaac. What is the moral of the story? According to our moral beliefs, shouldn t Abraham refuse to execute God s vicious plan? Isn t one of the fundamental beliefs of Christianity the respect to the life of other? The answer is naturally affirmative. Abraham should refuse God, and he should respect the ethical law. Then Abraham would be in a good relation with the Law itself as in the expression  a law abiding citizen . On the contrary what Abraham tries to achieve is a personal relation with the author of the moral law. This author is neither a symbolic figure nor an abstract idea; he is someone with a name. The name of  God  is the unpronounceable Tetragrammaton (YHVE), the unpronounceability indicates the simultaneous closeness and distance of the great Other. The Christian God then, the author of the moral law at his will suspends the law and demands his unlawful wish be obeyed. Jacques Derrida notes that the temptation is now for Abraham the ethical law itself (Derrida 1998:162): he must resist ethics, this is the mad logic of God. The story naturally raises many problems. Is not such a subjectivist model of truth and religion plainly dangerous? What if someone was to support his acts of violence as a command of God? Kierkegaard s response would be to suggest that it is only because Abraham loved Isaac with all his heart that the sacrifice could take place. He must love Isaac with his whole soul .only then can he sacrifice him  (Kierkegaard 1983:74). Abraham s faith is proved by the strength of his love for his son. However, this doesn t fully answer the question of legitimacy, even if we agree that Abraham believed that God loved him so that he would somehow spare him. Kierkegaard also differentiates between the act of Abraham and the act of a tragic hero (like Agamemnon sacrificing his daughter Iphigenia). The tragic hero s act is a product of calculation. What is better to do? What would be more beneficial? Abraham stands away from all sorts of calculations, he stands alone, that is, free in front of the horror religiosus, the price and the reward of faith. b. Friedrich Nietzsche (1844 - 1900) as an Existentialist Philosopher  I know my lot. Some day my name will be linked to the memory of something monstrous, of a crisis as yet unprecedented on earth   (Nietzsche 2007:88). Remarkably, what in 1888 sounded like megalomania came some years later to be realized. The name  Nietzsche  has been linked with an array of historical events, philosophical concepts and widespread popular legends. Above all, Nietzsche has managed somehow to associate his name with the turmoil of a crisis. For a while this crisis was linked to the events of WWII. The exploitation of his teaching by the Nazi ideologues (notably Alfred Rosenberg and Alfred Baeumler), although utterly misdirected, arguably had its source in Nietzsche s own  aristocratic radicalism . More generally, the crisis refers to the prospect of a future lacking of any meaning. This is a common theme for all the existentialists to be sure. The prospect of millennia of nihilism (the devaluation of the highest values) inaugurates for Nietzsche the era in which the human itself, for the first time in its history, is called to give meaning both to its own existence and to the existence of the world. This is an event of a cataclysmic magnitude, from now on there are neither guidelines to be followed, lighthouses to direct us, and no right answers but only experiments to be conducted with unknown results. Many existentialists, in their attempt to differentiate the value of individual existence from the alienating effects of the masses, formed an uneasy relation with the value of the  everyday man . The  common  man was thought to be lacking in will, taste in matter of aesthetics, and individuality in the sense that the assertion of his existence comes exclusively from his participation in larger groups and from the  herd  mentality with which these groups infuse their members. Nietzsche believed that men in society are divided and ordered according to their willingness and capacity to participate in a life of spiritual and cultural transformation. Certainly not everyone wishes this participation and Nietzsche s condemnation of those unwilling to challenge their fundamental beliefs is harsh; however it would be a mistake to suggest that Nietzsche thought their presence dispensable. In various aphorisms he stresses the importance of the  common  as a necessary prerequisite for both the growth and the value of the  exceptional . Such an idea clashes with our  modern  sensitivities (themselves a product of a particular training). However, one has to recognize that there are no philosophers without presuppositions, and that Nietzsche s insistence on the value of the exceptional marks his own beginning and his own understanding of the mission of thought. Despite the dubious politics that the crisis of meaning gave rise to, the crisis itself is only an after - effect of a larger and deeper challenge that Nietzsche s work identifies and poses. For Nietzsche the crisis of meaning is inextricably linked to the crisis of religious consciousness in the West. Whereas for Kierkegaard the problem of meaning was to be resolved through the individual s relation to the Divine, for Nietzsche the militantly anti - Christian, the problem of meaning is rendered possible at all because of the demise of the Divine. As he explains in The Genealogy of Morality, it is only after the cultivation of truth as a value by the priest that truth comes to question its own value and function. What truth discovers is that at the ground of all truth lies an unquestionable faith in the value of truth. Christianity is destroyed when it is pushed to tell the truth about itself, when the illusions of the old ideals are revealed. What is called  The death of God  is also then the death of truth (though not of the value of truthfulness); this is an event of immense consequences for the future. But one has to be careful here. Generations of readers, by concentrating on the event of the actual announcement of the  death of God , have completely missed madman s woeful mourning which follows the announcement. Where is God?  he cried;  I ll tell you! We have killed him   you and I! We are all his murderers. But how did we do this? How were we able to drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Where is it moving? Where are we moving to? Away from all suns?  (Nietzsche 2001:125). The above sentences are very far from constituting a cheerful declaration: no one is happy here! Nietzsche s atheism has nothing to do with the naive atheism of others (for example Sartre) who rush to affirm their freedom as if their petty individuality were able to fill the vast empty space left by the absence of God. Nietzsche is not naive and because he is not naive he is rather pessimistic. What the death of God really announces is the demise of the human as we know it. One has to think of this break in the history of the human in Kantian terms. Kant famously described Enlightenment as  man s emergence from his self - incurred immaturity  (Kant 1991:54). Similarly Nietzsche believes that the demise of the divine could be the opportunity for the emergence of a being which derives the meaning of its existence from within itself and not from some authority external to it. If the meaning of the human derived from God then, with the universe empty, man cannot take the place of the absent God. This empty space can only be filled by something greater and fuller, which in the Nietzschean jargon means the greatest unity of contradictory forces. That is the  bermensch (Overhuman) which for Nietzsche signifies the attempt towards the cultural production of a human being which will be aware of his dual descent   from animality and from rationality   without prioritizing either one, but keeping them in an agonistic balance so that through struggle new and exciting forms of human existence can be born. Nietzsche was by training a Klassische Philologe (the rough equivalent Anglosaxon would be an expert in classics   the texts of the ancient Greek and Roman authors). Perhaps because of his close acquaintance with the ancient writers, he became sensitive to a quite different understanding of philosophical thinking to that of his contemporaries. For the Greeks, philosophical questioning takes place within the perspective of a certain choice of life. There is no  life  and then quite separately the theoretical (theoria: from thea   view, and horan   to see) or  from a distance  contemplation of phenomena. Philosophical speculation is the result of a certain way of life and the attempted justification of this life. Interestingly Kant encapsulates this attitude in the following passage:  When will you finally begin to live virtuously?  said Plato to an old man who told him he was attending classes on virtue. The point is not always to speculate, but also ultimately to think about applying our knowledge. Today, however, he who lives in conformity with what he teaches is taken for a dreamer  (Kant in Hadot 2002:xiii). We have to understand Nietzsche s relation to philosophy within this context not only because it illustrates a stylistically different contemplation but because it demonstrates an altogether different way of philosophizing. Thus in Twilight of the Idols Nietzsche accuses philosophers for their  Egyptism , the fact that they turn everything into a concept under evaluation. All that philosophers have been handling for thousands of years is conceptual mummies; nothing real has ever left their hands alive  (Nietzsche 1998:16). Philosophical concepts are valuable insofar as they serve a flourishing life, not as academic exercises. Under the new model of philosophy the old metaphysical and moral questions are to be replaced by new questions concerning history, genealogy, environmental conditions and so forth. Let us take a characteristic passage from 1888:  I am interested in a question on which the  salvation of humanity  depends more than on any curio of the theologians: the question of nutrition. For ease of use, one can put it in the following terms:  how do you personally have to nourish yourself in order to attain your maximum of strength, of virt  in the Renaissance style, of moraline - free virtue?  (Nietzsche 2007:19). What is Nietzsche telling us here? Two things: firstly that, following the tradition of Spinoza, the movement from transcendence to immanence passes through the rehabilitation of the body. To say that, however, does not imply a simple - minded materialism. When Spinoza tells  nobody as yet has determined the limits of the body s capabilities  (Spinoza 2002: 280) he is not writing about something like bodily strength but to the possibility of an emergence of a body liberated from the sedimentation of culture and memory. This archetypical body is indeed as yet unknown and we stand in ignorance of its abilities. The second thing that Nietzsche is telling us in the above passage is that this new immanent philosophy necessarily requires a new ethics. One has to be clear here because of the many misunderstandings of Nietzschean ethics. Nietzsche is primarily a philosopher of ethics but ethics here refers to the possible justification of a way of life, which way of life in turn justifies human existence on earth. For Nietzsche, ethics does not refer to moral codes and guidelines on how to live one s life. Morality, which Nietzsche rejects, refers to the obsessive need (a need or an instinct can also be learned according to Nietzsche) of the human to preserve its own species and to regard its species as higher than the other animals. In short morality is arrogant. A Nietzschean ethics is an ethics of modesty. It places the human back where it belongs, among the other animals. However to say that is not to equate the human with the animal. Unlike non - human animals men are products of history that is to say products of memory. That is their burden and their responsibility. In the Genealogy of Morality Nietzsche explains morality as a system aiming at the taming of the human animal. Morality s aim is the elimination of the creative power of animal instincts and the establishment of a life protected within the cocoon of ascetic ideals. These  ideals  are all those values and ideologies made to protect man against the danger of nihilism, the state in which man finds no answer to the question of his existence. Morality clings to the preservation of the species  man ; morality stubbornly denies the very possibility of an open - ended future for humans. If we could summarize Nietzsche s philosophical anthropology in a few words, we would say that for Nietzsche it is necessary to attempt (there are no guarantees here) to think of the human not as an end - in - itself but only as a means to something   perfect, completely finished, happy, powerful, triumphant, that still leaves something to fear!  (Nietzsche 2007:25). c. Martin Heidegger (1889 - 1976) as an Existentialist Philosopher Heidegger exercised an unparalleled influence on modern thought. Without knowledge of his work recent developments in modern European philosophy (Sartre, Gadamer, Arendt, Marcuse, Derrida, Foucault et al.) simply do not make sense. He remains notorious for his involvement with National Socialism in the 1930 s. Outside European philosophy, Heidegger is only occasionally taken seriously, and is sometimes actually ridiculed (famously the Oxford philosopher A. J. Ayer called him a  charlatan ). In 1945 in Paris Jean - Paul Sartre gave a public lecture with the title  Existentialism is a Humanism  where he defended the priority of action and the position that it is a man s actions which define his humanity. In 1946, Jean Beaufret in a letter to Heidegger poses a number of questions concerning the link between humanism and the recent developments of existentialist philosophy in France. Heidegger s response is a letter to Beaufret which in 1947 is published in a book form with the title  Letter on Humanism . There he repudiates any possible connection of his philosophy with the existentialism of Sartre. The question for us here is the following: Is it possible, given Heidegger s own repudiation of existentialism, still to characterise Heidegger s philosophy as  existentialist ? The answer here is that Heidegger can be classified as an existentialist thinker despite all his differences from Sartre. Our strategy is to stress Heidegger s connection with some key existentialist concerns, which we introduced above under the labels  Existence ,  Anxiety  and the  Crowd . We have seen above that a principle concern of all existentialists was to affirm the priority of individual existence and to stress that human existence is to be investigated with methods other than those of the natural sciences. This is also one of Heidegger s principle concerns. His magnum opus Being and Time is an investigation into the meaning of Being as that manifests itself through the human being, Dasein. The sciences have repeatedly asked  What is a man? What is a car? What is an emotion?  they have nevertheless failed   and because of the nature of science, had to fail   to ask the question which grounds all those other questions. This question is what is the meaning of (that) Being which is not an entity (like other beings, for example a chair, a car, a rock) and yet through it entities have meaning at all? Investigating the question of the meaning of Being we discover that it arises only because it is made possible by the human being which poses the question. Dasein has already a (pre - conceptual) understanding of Being because it is the place where Being manifests itself. Unlike the traditional understanding of the human as a hypokeimenon (Aristotle)   what through the filtering of Greek thought by the Romans becomes substantia, that which supports all entities and qualities as their base and their ground   Dasein refers to the way which human beings are. The essence of Dasein lies in its existence  (Heidegger 1962: 67) and the existence of Dasein is not fixed like the existence of a substance is. This is why human beings locate a place which nevertheless remains unstable and unfixed. The virtual place that Dasein occupies is not empty. It is filled with beings which ontologically structure the very possibility of Dasein. Dasein exists as in - the - world. World is not something separate from Dasein; rather, Dasein cannot be understood outside the referential totality which constitutes it. Heidegger repeats here a familiar existentialist pattern regarding the situatedness of experience. Sartre, by contrast, comes from the tradition of Descartes and to this tradition remains faithful. From Heidegger s perspective, Sartre s strategy of affirming the priority of existence over essence is a by - product of the tradition of Renaissance humanism which wishes to assert the importance of man as the highest and most splendid of finite beings. Sartrean existence refers to the fact that a human is whereas Heidegger s ek - sistence refers to the way with which Dasein is thrown into a world of referential relations and as such Dasein is claimed by Being to guard its truth. Sartre, following Descartes, thinks of the human as a substance producing or sustaining entities, Heidegger on the contrary thinks of the human as a passivity which accepts the call of Being. Man is not the lord of beings. Man is the shepherd of Being  (Heidegger 1993:245). The Heideggerian priority then is Being, and Dasein s importance lies in its receptiveness to the call of Being. For Kierkegaard anxiety defines the possibility of responsibility, the exodus of man from the innocence of Eden and his participation to history. But the birthplace of anxiety is the experience of nothingness, the state in which every entity is experienced as withdrawn from its functionality. Nothing   gives birth to anxiety  (Kierkegaard 1980:41). In anxiety we do not fear something in particular but we experience the terror of a vacuum in which is existence is thrown. Existentialist thinkers are interested in anxiety because anxiety individualizes one (it is when I feel Angst more than everything that I come face to face with my own individual existence as distinct from all other entities around me). Heidegger thinks that one of the fundamental ways with which Dasein understands itself in the world is through an array of  moods . Dasein always  finds itself  (befinden sich) in a certain mood. Man is not a thinking thing de - associated from the world, as in Cartesian metaphysics, but a being which finds itself in various moods such as anxiety or boredom. For the Existentialists, primarily and for the most part I don t exist because I think (recall Descartes  famous formula) but because my moods reveal to me fundamental truths of my existence. Like Kierkegaard, Heidegger also believes that anxiety is born out of the terror of nothingness. The obstinacy of the  nothing and nowhere within - the - world  means as a phenomenon that the world as such is that in the face of which one has anxiety  (Heidegger 1962:231). For Kierkegaard the possibility of anxiety reveals man s dual nature and because of this duality man can be saved. If a human being were a beast or an angel, he could not be in anxiety. Because he is a synthesis, he can be in anxiety; and the more profoundly he is in anxiety, the greater is the man  (Kierkegaard 1980:155). Equally for Heidegger anxiety manifests Dasein s possibility to live an authentic existence since it realizes that the crowd of  others  (what Heidegger calls the  They ) cannot offer any consolation to the drama of existence. In this article we have discussed the ambiguous or at times downright critical attitude of many existentialists toward the uncritical and unreflecting masses of people who, in a wholly anti - Kantian and thus also anti - Enlightenment move, locate the meaning of their existence in an external authority. They thus give up their (purported) autonomy as rational beings. For Heidegger, Dasein for the most part lives inauthentically in that Dasein is absorbed in a way of life produced by others, not by Dasein itself. We take pleasure and enjoy ourselves as they  man  take pleasure; we read, see and judge about literature and art as they see and judge   (Heidegger 1962:164). To be sure this mode of existence, the  They  (Das Man) is one of the existentialia, it is an a priori condition of possibility of the Dasein which means that inauthenticity is inscribed into the mode of being of Dasein, it does not come from the outside as a bad influence which could be erased. Heidegger s language is ambiguous on the problem of inauthenticity and the reader has to make his mind on the status of the  They . A lot has been said on the possible connections of Heidegger s philosophy with his political engagements. Although it is always a risky business to read the works of great philosophers as political manifestos, it seems prima facie evident that Heidegger s thought in this area deserves the close investigation it has received. Heidegger was a highly original thinker. His project was nothing less than the overcoming of Western metaphysics through the positing of the forgotten question of being. He stands in a critical relation to past philosophers but simultaneously he is heavily indebted to them, much more than he would like to admit. This is not to question his originality, it is to recognize that thought is not an ex nihilo production; it comes as a response to things past, and aims towards what is made possible through that past. d. Jean - Paul Sartre (1905 - 1980) as an Existentialist Philosopher In the public consciousness, at least, Sartre must surely be the central figure of existentialism. All the themes that we introduced above come together in his work. With the possible exception of Nietzsche, his writings are the most widely anthologised (especially the lovely, if oversimplifying, lecture  Existentialism and Humanism ) and his literary works are widely read (especially the novel Nausea) or performed. Although uncomfortable in the limelight, he was nevertheless the very model of a public intellectual, writing hundreds of short pieces for public dissemination and taking resolutely independent and often controversial stands on major political events. His writings that are most clearly existentialist in character date from Sartre s early and middle period, primarily the 1930 s and 1940 s. From the 1950 s onwards, Sartre moved his existentialism towards a philosophy the purpose of which was to understand the possibility of a genuinely revolutionary politics. Sartre was in his late 20 s when he first encountered phenomenology, specifically the philosophical ideas of Edmund Husserl. (We should point out that Heidegger was also deeply influenced by Husserl, but it is less obvious in the language he employs because he drops the language of consciousness and acts.) Of particular importance, Sartre thought, was Husserl s notion of intentionality. In Sartre s interpretation of this idea, consciousness is not to be identified with a thing (for example a mind, soul or brain), that is to say some kind of a repository of ideas and images of things. Rather, consciousness is nothing but a directedness towards things. Sartre found a nice way to sum up the notion of the intentional object: If I love her, I love her because she is lovable (Sartre 1970:4 - 5). Within my experience, her lovableness is not an aspect of my image of her, rather it is a feature of her (and ultimately a part of the world) towards which my consciousness directs itself. The things I notice about her (her smile, her laugh) are not originally neutral, and then I interpret the idea of them as  lovely , they are aspects of her as lovable. The notion that consciousness is not a thing is vital to Sartre. Indeed, consciousness is primarily to be characterised as nothing: it is first and foremost not that which it is conscious of. (Sartre calls human existence the  for - itself , and the being of things the  in - itself .) Because it is not a thing, it is not subject to the laws of things; specifically, it is not part of a chain of causes and its identity is not akin to that of a substance. Above we suggested that a concern with the nature of existence, and more particularly a concern with the distinctive nature of human existence, are defining existentialist themes. Moreover, qua consciousness, and not a thing that is part of the causal chain, I am free. From moment to moment, my every action is mine alone to choose. I will of course have a past  me  that cannot be dispensed with; this is part of my  situation . However, again, I am first and foremost not my situation. Thus, at every moment I choose whether to continue on that life path, or to be something else. Thus, my existence (the mere fact that I am) is prior to my essence (what I make of myself through my free choices). I am thus utterly responsible for myself. If my act is not simply whatever happens to come to mind, then my action may embody a more general principle of action. This principle too is one that I must have freely chosen and committed myself to. It is an image of the type of life that I believe has value. (In these ways, Sartre intersects with the broadly Kantian account of freedom which we introduced above in our thematic section.) As situated, I also find myself surrounded by such images   from religion, culture, politics or morality   but none compels my freedom. (All these forces that seek to appropriate my freedom by objectifying me form Sartre s version of the crowd theme.) I exist as freedom, primarily characterised as not determined, so my continuing existence requires the ever renewed exercise of freedom (thus, in our thematic discussion above, the notion from Spinoza and Leibniz of existence as a striving - to - exist). Thus also, my non - existence, and the non - existence of everything I believe in, is only a free choice away. I (in the sense of an authentic human existence) am not what I  am  (the past I have accumulated, the things that surround me, or the way that others view me). I am alone in my responsibility; my existence, relative to everything external that might give it meaning, is absurd. Face to face with such responsibility, I feel  anxiety . Notice that although Sartre s account of situatedness owes much to Nietzsche and Heidegger, he sees it primarily in terms of what gives human freedom its meaning and its burden. Nietzsche and Heidegger, in contrast, view such a conception of freedom as naively metaphysical. Suppose, however, that at some point I am conscious of myself in a thing - like way. For example, I say  I am a student  (treating myself as having a fixed, thing - like identity) or  I had no choice  (treating myself as belonging to the causal chain). I am ascribing a fixed identity or set of qualities to myself, much as I would say  that is a piece of granite . In that case I am existing in denial of my distinctively human mode of existence; I am fleeing from my freedom. This is inauthenticity or  bad faith . As we shall see, inauthenticity is not just an occasional pitfall of human life, but essential to it. Human existence is a constant falling away from an authentic recognition of its freedom. Sartre here thus echoes the notion in Heidegger than inauthenticity is a condition of possibility of human existence. Intentionality manifests itself in another important way. Rarely if ever am I simply observing the world; instead I am involved in wanting to do something, I have a goal or purpose. Here, intentional consciousness is not a static directedness towards things, but is rather an active projection towards the future. Suppose that I undertake as my project marrying my beloved. This is an intentional relation to a future state of affairs. As free, I commit myself to this project and must reaffirm that commitment at every moment. It is part of my life project, the image of human life that I offer to myself and to others as something of value. Notice, however, that my project involves inauthenticity. I project myself into the future where I will be married to her   that is, I define myself as  married , as if I were a fixed being. Thus there is an essential tension to all projection. On the one hand, the mere fact that I project myself into the future is emblematic of my freedom; only a radically free consciousness can project itself. I exist as projecting towards the future which, again, I am not. Thus, I am (in the sense of an authentic self) what I am not (because my projecting is always underway towards the future). On the other hand, in projecting I am projecting myself as something, that is, as a thing that no longer projects, has no future, is not free. Every action, then, is both an expression of freedom and also a snare of freedom. Projection is absurd: I seek to become the impossible object, for - itself - in - itself, a thing that is both free and a mere thing. Born of this tension is a recognition of freedom, what it entails, and its essential fragility. Thus, once again, we encounter existential anxiety. (In this article, we have not stressed the importance of the concept of time for existentialism, but it should not be overlooked: witness one of Nietzsche s most famous concepts (eternal recurrence) and the title of Heidegger s major early work (Being and Time).) In my intentional directedness towards my beloved I find her  loveable . This too, though, is an objectification. Within my intentional gaze, she is loveable in much the same way that granite is hard or heavy. Insofar as I am in love, then, I seek to deny her freedom. Insofar, however, as I wish to be loved by her, then she must be free to choose me as her beloved. If she is free, she escapes my love; if not, she cannot love. It is in these terms that Sartre analyses love in Part Three of Being and Nothingness. Love here is a case study in the basic forms of social relation. Sartre is thus moving from an entirely individualistic frame of reference (my self, my freedom and my projects) towards a consideration of the self in concrete relations with others. Sartre is working through   in a way he would shortly see as being inadequate   the issues presented by the Hegelian dialectic of recognition, which we mentioned above. This  hell  of endlessly circling acts of freedom and objectification is brilliantly dramatised in Sartre s play No Exit. A few years later at the end of the 1940 s, Sartre wrote what has been published as Notebooks for an Ethics. Sartre (influenced in the meantime by the criticisms of Merleau - Ponty and de Beauvoir, and by his increasing commitment to collectivist politics) elaborated greatly his existentialist account of relations with others, taking the Hegelian idea more seriously. He no longer thinks of concrete relations so pessimistically. While Nietzsche and Heidegger both suggest the possibility of an authentic being with others, both leave it seriously under - developed. For our purposes, there are two key ideas in the Notebooks. The first is that my projects can be realised only with the cooperation of others; however, that cooperation presupposes their freedom (I cannot make her love me), and their judgements about me must concern me. Therefore permitting and nurturing the freedom of others must be a central part of all my projects. Sartre thus commits himself against any political, social or economic forms of subjugation. Second, there is the possibility of a form of social organisation and action in which each individual freely gives him or herself over to a joint project: a  city of ends  (this is a reworking of Kant s idea of the  kingdom of ends , found in the Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals). An authentic existence, for Sartre, therefore means two things. First, it is something like a  style  of existing   one that at every moment is anxious, and that means fully aware of the absurdity and fragility of its freedom. Second, though, there is some minimal level of content to any authentic project: whatever else my project is, it must also be a project of freedom, for myself and for others. e. Simone de Beauvoir (1908 - 1986) as an Existentialist Philosopher Simone de Beauvoir was the youngest student ever to pass the demanding agr gation at the prestigious  cole Normale Sup rieure. Subsequently a star Normalienne, she was a writer, philosopher, feminist, lifelong partner of Jean - Paul Sartre, notorious for her anti - bourgeois way of living and her free sexual relationships which included among others a passionate affair with the American writer Nelson Algren. Much ink has been spilled debating whether de Beauvoir s work constitutes a body of independent philosophical work, or is a reformulation of Sartre s work. The debate rests of course upon the fundamental misconception that wants a body of work to exist and develop independently of (or uninfluenced by) its intellectual environment. Such  objectivity  is not only impossible but also undesirable: such a body of work would be ultimately irrelevant since it would be non - communicable. So the question of de Beauvoir s  independence  could be dismissed here as irrelevant to the philosophical questions that her work raises. In 1943 Being and Nothingness, the groundwork of the Existentialist movement in France was published. There Sartre gave an account of freedom as ontological constitutive of the subject. One cannot but be free: this is the kernel of the Sartrean conception of freedom. In 1945 Merleau - Ponty s Phenomenology of Perception is published. There, as well as in an essay from the same year titled  The war has taken place , Merleau - Ponty heavily criticizes the Sartrean stand, criticising it as a reformulation of basic Stoic tenets. One cannot assume freedom in isolation from the freedom of others. Action is participatory:   my freedom is interwoven with that of others by way of the world  (Merleau - Ponty in Stewart 1995:315). Moreover action takes place within a certain historical context. For Merleau - Ponty the subjective free - will is always in a dialectical relationship with its historical context. In 1947 Simone de Beauvoir s Ethics of Ambiguity is published. The book is an introduction to existentialism but also a subtle critique of Sartre s position on freedom, and a partial extension of existentialism towards the social. Although de Beauvoir will echo Merleau - Ponty s criticism regarding the essential interrelation of the subjects, nevertheless she will leave unstressed the importance that the social context plays in the explication of moral problems. Like Sartre it is only later in her life that this will be acknowledged. In any case, de Beauvoir s book precipitates in turn a major rethink on Sartre s part, and the result is the Notebooks for an Ethics. In Ethics of Ambiguity de Beauvoir offers a picture of the human subject as constantly oscillating between facticity and transcendence. Whereas the human is always already restricted by the brute facts of his existence, nevertheless it always aspires to overcome its situation, to choose its freedom and thus to create itself. This tension must be considered positive, and not restrictive of action. It is exactly because the ontology of the human is a battleground of antithetical movements (a view consistent with de Beauvoir s Hegelianism) that the subject must produce an ethics which will be continuous with its ontological core. The term for this tension is ambiguity. Ambiguity is not a quality of the human as substance, but a characterisation of human existence. We are ambiguous beings destined to throw ourselves into the future while simultaneously it is our very own existence that throws us back into facticity. That is to say, back to the brute fact that we are in a sense always already destined to fail   not in this or that particular project but to fail as pure and sustained transcendence. It is exactly because of (and through) this fundamental failure that we realize that our ethical relation to the world cannot be self - referential but must pass through the realization of the common destiny of the human as a failed and interrelated being. De Beauvoir, unlike Sartre, was a scholarly reader of Hegel. Her position on an existential ethics is thus more heavily influenced by Hegel s view in the Phenomenology of Spirit concerning the moment of recognition (Hegel 1977:111). There Hegel describes the movement in which self - consciousness produces itself by positing another would be self - consciousness, not as a mute object (Gegen - stand) but as itself self - consciousness. The Hegelian movement remains one of the most fascinating moments in the history of philosophy since it is for the first time that the constitution of the self does not take place from within the self (as happens with Descartes, for whom the only truth is the truth of my existence; or Leibniz, for whom the monads are  windowless ; or Fichte, for whom the  I  is absolutely self - constitutive) but from the outside. It is, Hegel tells us, only because someone else recognizes me as a subject that I can be constituted as such. Outside the moment of recognition there is no self - consciousness. De Beauvoir takes to heart the Hegelian lesson and tries to formulate an ethics from it. What would this ethics be? As in Nietzsche, ethics refers to a way of life (a     ), as opposed to morality which concerns approved or condemned behaviour. Thus there are no recipes for ethics. Drawn from Hegel s moment of recognition, de Beauvoir acknowledges that the possibility of human flourishing is based firstly upon the recognition of the existence of the other ( Man can find a justification of his own existence only in the existence of the other men  (Beauvoir 1976:72) and secondly on the recognition that my own flourishing (or my ability to pose projects, in the language of existentialists) passes through the possibility of a common flourishing. Only the freedom of others keeps each one of us from hardening in the absurdity of facticity,  (Beauvoir 1976:71) de Beauvoir writes; or again  To will oneself free is also to will others free  (Beauvoir 1976:73). The Ethics of Ambiguity ends by declaring the necessity of assuming one s freedom and the assertion that it is only through action that freedom makes itself possible. This is not a point to be taken light - heartedly. It constitutes a movement of opposition against a long tradition of philosophy understanding itself as theoria: the disinterested contemplation on the nature of the human and the world. De Beauvoir, in common with most existentialists, understands philosophy as praxis: involved action in the world and participation in the course of history. It is out of this understanding that The Second Sex is born. In 1949 Le Deuxi me Sexe is published in France. In English in 1953 it appeared as The Second Sex in an abridged translation. The book immediately became a best seller and later a founding text of Second Wave Feminism (the feminist movement from the early 60 s to the 70 s inspired by the civil rights movement and focusing at the theoretical examination of the concepts of equality, inequality, the role of family, justice and so forth). More than anything, The Second Sex constitutes a study in applied existentialism where the abstract concept  Woman  gives way to the examination of the lives of everyday persons struggling against oppression and humiliation. When de Beauvoir says that there is no such thing as a  Woman  we have to hear the echo of the Kierkegaardian assertion of the single individual against the abstractions of Hegelian philosophy, or similarly Sartre s insistence on the necessity of the prioritization of the personal lives of self - creating people (what Sartre calls  existence ) as opposed to a pre - established ideal of what humans should be like (what Sartre calls  essence ). The Second Sex is an exemplary text showing how a philosophical movement can have real, tangible effects on the lives of many people, and is a magnificent exercise in what philosophy could be. I hesitated a long time before writing a book on woman. The subject is irritating, especially for women   (Beauvoir 2009:3). The Second Sex begins with the most obvious (but rarely posed) question: What is woman? De Beauvoir finds that at present there is no answer to that question. The reason is that tradition has always thought of woman as the other of man. It is only man that constitutes himself as a subject (as the Absolute de Beauvoir says), and woman defines herself only through him. She determines and differentiates herself in relation to man, and he does not in relation to her; she is the inessential in front of the essential   (Beauvoir 2009:6). But why is it that woman has initially accepted or tolerated this process whereby she becomes the other of man? De Beauvoir does not give a consoling answer; on the contrary, by turning to Sartre s notion of bad faith (which refers to the human being s anxiety in front of the responsibility entailed by the realization of its radical freedom) she thinks that women at times are complicit to their situation. It is indeed easier for one   anyone   to assume the role of an object (for example a housewife  kept  by her husband) than to take responsibility for creating him or herself and creating the possibilities of freedom for others. Naturally the condition of bad faith is not always the case. Often women found themselves in a sociocultural environment which denied them the very possibility of personal flourishing (as happens with most of the major religious communities). A further problem that women face is that of understanding themselves as a unity which would enable them to assume the role of their choosing. Proletarians say  we . So do blacks  (Beauvoir 2009:8). By saying  we  they assume the role of the subject and turn everyone else into  other . Women are unable to utter this  we . They live dispersed among men, tied by homes, work, economic interests and social conditions to certain men   fathers or husbands   more closely than to other women. As bourgeois women, they are in solidarity with bourgeois men and not with women proletarians; as white women, they are in solidarity with white men and not with black women  (Beauvoir 2009:9). Women primarily align themselves to their class or race and not to other women. The female identity is  very much bound up with the identity of the men around them   (Reynolds 2006:145). One of the most celebrated moments in The Second Sex is the much quoted phrase:  One is not born, but rather becomes, woman  (Beauvoir 2009:293). She explains:  No biological, physical or economic destiny defines the figure that the human female takes on in society; it is civilization as a whole that elaborates this intermediary product between the male and the eunuch that is called feminine  (Beauvoir 2009:293). For some feminists this clearly inaugurates the problematic of the sex - gender distinction (where sex denotes the biological identity of the person and gender the cultural attribution of properties to the sexed body). Simply put, there is absolutely nothing that determines the  assumed  femininity of the woman (how a woman acts, feels, behaves)   everything that we have come to think as  feminine  is a social construction not a natural given. Later feminists like Monique Wittig and Judith Butler will argue that  sex  is already  gender  in the sense that a sexed body exists always already within a cultural nexus that defines it. Thus the sex assignment (a doctor pronouncing the sex of the baby) is a naturalized (but not at all natural) normative claim which delivers the human into a world of power relations. f. Albert Camus (1913 - 1960) as an Existentialist Philosopher Albert Camus was a French intellectual, writer and journalist. His multifaceted work as well as his ambivalent relation to both philosophy and existentialism makes every attempt to classify him a rather risky operation. A recipient of the 1957 Nobel Prize for Literature primarily for his novels, he is also known as a philosopher due to his non - literary work and his relation with Jean - Paul Sartre. And yet his response was clear:  I am not a philosopher, because I don t believe in reason enough to believe in a system. What interests me is knowing how we must behave, and more precisely, how to behave when one does not believe in God or reason  (Camus in Sherman 2009: 1). The issue is not just about the label  existentialist . It rather points to a deep tension within the current of thought of all thinkers associated with existentialism. The question is: With how many voices can thought speak? As we have already seen, the thinkers of existentialism often deployed more than one. Almost all of them share a deep suspicion to a philosophy operating within reason as conceived of by the Enlightenment. Camus shares this suspicion and his so called philosophy of the absurd intends to set limits to the overambitions of Western rationality. Reason is absurd in that it believes that it can explain the totality of the human experience whereas it is exactly its inability for explanation that, for example, a moment of fall designates. Thus in his novel  The Fall  the protagonist s tumultuous narrative reveals the overtaking of a life of superficial regularity by the forces of darkness and irrationality. A bourgeois hell, inhabited of course by bad dreams  (Camus 2006:10). In a similar fashion Camus has also repudiated his connection with existentialism. Non, je ne suis pas existentialist  is the title of a famous interview that he gave for the magazine Les Nouvelles Litt raires on the 15 of November, 1945. The truth of the matter is that Camus  rejection of existentialism is directed more toward Sartre s version of it rather than toward a dismissal of the main problems that the existential thinkers faced. Particularly, Camus was worried that Sartre s deification of history (Sartre s proclaimed Marxism) would be incompatible with the affirmation of personal freedom. Camus accuses Hegel (subsequently Marx himself) of reducing man to history and thus denying man the possibility of creating his own history, that is, affirming his freedom. Philosophically, Camus is known for his conception of the absurd. Perhaps we should clarify from the very beginning what the absurd is not. The absurd is not nihilism. For Camus the acceptance of the absurd does not lead to nihilism (according to Nietzsche nihilism denotes the state in which the highest values devalue themselves) or to inertia, but rather to their opposite: to action and participation. The notion of the absurd signifies the space which opens up between, on the one hand, man s need for intelligibility and, on the other hand,  the unreasonable silence of the world  as he beautifully puts it. In a world devoid of God, eternal truths or any other guiding principle, how could man bear the responsibility of a meaning - giving activity? The absurd man, like an astronaut looking at the earth from above, wonders whether a philosophical system, a religion or a political ideology is able to make the world respond to the questioning of man, or rather whether all human constructions are nothing but the excessive face - paint of a clown which is there to cover his sadness. This terrible suspicion haunts the absurd man. In one of the most memorable openings of a non - fictional book he states:  There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. All the rest   whether or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or twelve categories   comes afterwards. These are games; one must first answer  (Camus 2000:11). The problem of suicide (a deeply personal problem) manifests the exigency of a meaning - giving response. Indeed for Camus a suicidal response to the problem of meaning would be the confirmation that the absurd has taken over man s inner life. It would mean that man is not any more an animal going after answers, in accordance with some inner drive that leads him to act in order to endow the world with meaning. The suicide has become but a passive recipient of the muteness of the world. The absurd   is simultaneously awareness and rejection of death  (Camus 2000:54). One has to be aware of death   because it is precisely the realization of man s mortality that pushes someone to strive for answers   and one has ultimately to reject death   that is, reject suicide as well as the living death of inertia and inaction. At the end one has to keep the absurd alive, as Camus says. But what does it that mean? In The Myth of Sisyphus Camus tells the story of the mythical Sisyphus who was condemned by the Gods to ceaselessly roll a rock to the top of a mountain and then have to let it fall back again of its own weight. Sisyphus, proletarian of the gods, powerless and rebellious, knows the whole extent of his wretched condition: it is what he thinks of during his descent. The lucidity that was to constitute his torture at the same time crowns his victory. There is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn  (Camus 2000:109). One must imagine then Sisyphus victorious: fate and absurdity have been overcome by a joyful contempt. Scorn is the appropriate response in the face of the absurd; another name for this  scorn  though would be artistic creation. When Camus says:  One does not discover the absurd without being tempted to write a manual of happiness  (Camus 2000:110) he writes about a moment of exhilarated madness, which is the moment of the genesis of the artistic work. Madness, but nevertheless profound   think of the function of the Fool in Shakespeare s King Lear as the one who reveals to the king the most profound truths through play, mimicry and songs. Such madness can overcome the absurd without cancelling it altogether. Almost ten years after the publication of The Myth of Sisyphus Camus publishes his second major philosophical work, The Rebel (1951). Camus continues the problematic which had begun with The Myth of Sisyphus. Previously, revolt or creation had been considered the necessary response to the absurdity of existence. Here, Camus goes on to examine the nature of rebellion and its multiple manifestations in history. In The Myth of Sisyphus, in truly Nietzschean fashion, Camus had said:  There is but one useful action, that of remaking man and the earth  (Camus 2000:31). However, in The Rebel, reminiscent of Orwell s Animal Farm, one of the first points he makes is the following:  The slave starts by begging for justice and ends by wanting to wear a crown. He too wants to dominate  (Camus 2000 b:31). The problem is that while man genuinely rebels against both unfair social conditions and, as Camus says, against the whole of creation, nevertheless in the practical administration of such revolution, man comes to deny the humanity of the other in an attempt to impose his own individuality. Take for example the case of the infamous Marquis de Sade which Camus explores. In Sade, contradictory forces are at work (see The 120 Days of Sodom). On the one hand, Sade wishes the establishment of a (certainly mad) community with desire as the ultimate master, and on the other hand this very desire consumes itself and all the subjects who stand in its way. Camus goes on to examine historical manifestations of rebellion, the most prominent case being that of the French Revolution. Camus argues that the revolution ended up taking the place of the transcendent values which it sought to abolish. An all - powerful notion of justice now takes the place formerly inhabited by God. Rousseau s infamous suggestion that under the rule of  general will  everyone would be  forced to be free  (Rousseau in Foley 2008:61) opens the way to the crimes committed after the revolution. Camus fears that all revolutions end with the re - establishment of the State. Seventeen eighty - nine brings Napoleon; 1848 Napoleon III; 1917 Stalin; the Italian disturbances of the twenties, Mussolini; the Weimar Republic, Hitler  (Camus 2000 b:146). Camus is led to examine the Marxist view of history as a possible response to the failed attempts at the establishment of a true revolutionary regime. Camus examines the similarities between the Christian and the Marxist conception of history. They both exhibit a bourgeois preoccupation with progress. In the name of the future everything can be justified:  the future is the only kind of property that the masters willingly concede to the slaves  (Camus 2000 b:162). History according to both views is the linear progress from a set beginning to a definite end (the metaphysical salvation of man or the materialistic salvation of him in the future Communist society). Influenced by Koj ve s reading of Hegel, Camus interprets this future, classless society as the  end of history . The  end of history  suggests that when all contradictions cease then history itself will come to an end. This is, Camus argues, essentially nihilistic: history, in effect, accepts that meaning creation is no longer possible and commits suicide. Because historical revolutions are for the most part nihilistic movements, Camus suggests that it is the making - absolute of the values of the revolution that necessarily lead to their negation. On the contrary a relative conception of these values will be able to sustain a community of free individuals who have not forgotten that every historical rebellion has begun by affirming a proto - value (that of human solidarity) upon which every other value can be based. 3. The Influence of Existentialism a. The Arts and Psychology In the field of visual arts existentialism exercised an enormous influence, most obviously on the movement of Expressionism. Expressionism began in Germany at the beginning of the 20 th century. With its emphasis on subjective experience, Angst and intense emotionality, German expressionism sought to go beyond the naivet  of realist representation and to deal with the anguish of the modern man (exemplified in the terrible experiences of WWI). Many of the artists of Expressionism read Nietzsche intensively and following Nietzsche s suggestion for a transvaluation of values experimented with alternative lifestyles. Erich Heckel s woodcut  Friedrich Nietzsche  from 1905 is a powerful reminder of the movement s connection to Existentialist thought. Abstract expressionism (which included artists such as de Kooning and Pollock, and theorists such as Rosenberg) continued with some of the same themes in the United States from the 1940 s and tended to embrace existentialism as one of its intellectual guides, especially after Sartre s US lecture tour in 1946 and a production of No Exit in New York. German Expressionism was particularly important during the birth of the new art of cinema. Perhaps the closest cinematic work to Existentialist concerns remains F. W. Murnau s The Last Laugh (1924) in which the constantly moving camera (which prefigures the  rule  of the hand - held camera of the Danish Dogma 95) attempts to arrest the spiritual anguish of a man who suddenly finds himself in a meaningless world. Expressionism became a world - wide style within cinema, especially as film directors like Lang fled Germany and ended up in Hollywood. Jean Genet s Un chant d amour (1950) is a moving poetic exploration of desire. In the sordid, claustrophobic cells of a prison the inmates  craving for intimacy takes place against the background of an unavoidable despair for existence itself. European directors such as Bergman and Godard are often associated with existentialist themes. Godard s Vivre sa vie (My Life to Live, 1962) is explicit in its exploration of the nature of freedom under conditions of extreme social and personal pressure. In the late 20 th and early 21 st centuries existentialist ideas became common in mainstream cinema, pervading the work of writers and directors such as Woody Allen, Richard Linklater, Charlie Kaufman and Christopher Nolan. Given that Sartre and Camus were both prominent novelists and playwrights, the influence of existentialism on literature is not surprising. However, the influence was also the other way. Novelists such as Dostoevsky or Kafka, and the dramatist Ibsen, were often cited by mid - century existentialists as important precedents, right along with Kierkegaard and Nietzsche. Dostoevsky creates a character Ivan Karamazov (in The Brothers Karamazov, 1880) who holds the view that if God is dead, then everything is permitted; both Nietzsche and Sartre discuss Dostoevsky with enthusiasm. Within drama, the theatre of the absurd and most obviously Beckett were influenced by existentialist ideas; later playwrights such as Albee, Pinter and Stoppard continue this tradition. One of the key figures of 20 th century psychology, Sigmund Freud, was indebted to Nietzsche especially for his analysis of the role of psychology within culture and history, and for his view of cultural artefacts such as drama or music as  unconscious  documentations of psychological tensions. But a more explicit taking up of existentialist themes is found in the broad  existentialist psychotherapy  movement. A common theme within this otherwise very diverse group is that previous psychology misunderstood the fundamental nature of the human and especially its relation to others and to acts of meaning - giving; thus also, previous psychology had misunderstood what a  healthy  attitude to self, others and meaning might be. Key figures here include Swiss psychologists Ludwig Binswanger and later Menard Boss, both of who were enthusiastic readers of Heidegger; the Austrian Frankl, who invented the method of logotherapy; in England, Laing and Cooper, who were explicitly influenced by Sartre; and in the United States, Rollo May, who stresses the ineradicable importance of anxiety. b. Philosophy As a whole, existentialism has had relatively little direct influence within philosophy. In Germany, existentialism (and especially Heidegger) was criticised for being obscure, abstract or even mystical in nature. This criticism was made especially by Adorno in The Jargon of Authenticity, and in Dog Years, novelist Gunter Grass gives a Voltaire - like, savage satire of Heidegger. The criticism was echoed by many in the analytic tradition. Heidegger and the existentialist were also taken to task for paying insufficient attention to social and political structures or values, with dangerous results. In France, philosophers like Sartre were criticised by those newly under the influence of structuralism for paying insufficient attention to the nature of language and to impersonal structures of meaning. In short, philosophy moved on, and in different directions. Individual philosophers remain influential, however: Nietzsche and Heidegger in particular are very much  live  topics in philosophy, even in the 21 st century. However, there are some less direct influences that remain important. Let us raise three examples. Both the issue of freedom in relation to situation, and that of the philosophical significance of what otherwise might appear to be extraneous contextual factors, remain key, albeit in dramatically altered formulation, within the work of Michel Foucault or Alain Badiou, two figures central to late 20 th century European thought. Likewise, the philosophical importance that the existentialists placed upon emotion has been influential, legitimising a whole domain of philosophical research even by philosophers who have no interest in existentialism. Similarly, existentialism was a philosophy that insisted philosophy could and should deal very directly with  real world  topics such as sex, death or crime, topics that had most frequently been approached abstractly within the philosophical tradition. Mary Warnock wrote on existentialism and especially Sartre, for example, while also having an incredibly important and public role within recent applied ethics. 4. References and Further Reading a.

Nature of existentialist thought and manner According to existentialism: (1) Existence is always particular and individual always my existence, your existence, his existence, her existence. (2) Existence is primarily the problem of existence (i.e., of its mode of being); it is, therefore, also the investigation of the meaning of Being. (3) That investigation is continually faced with diverse possibilities, from among which the existent (i.e., the human individual) must make a selection, to which he must then commit himself. (4) Because those possibilities are constituted by the individual s relationships with things and with other humans, existence is always a being - in - the - world i.e., in a concrete and historically determinate situation that limits or conditions choice. Humans are therefore called, in Martin Heidegger s phrase, Dasein ( there being ) because they are defined by the fact that they exist, or are in the world and inhabit it. With respect to the first point, that existence is particular, existentialism is opposed to any doctrine that views human beings as the manifestation of an absolute or of an infinite substance. It is thus opposed to most forms of idealism, such as those that stress Consciousness, Spirit, Reason, Idea, or Oversoul. Second, it is opposed to any doctrine that sees in human beings some given and complete reality that must be resolved into its elements in order to be known or contemplated. It is thus opposed to any form of objectivism or scientism, since those approaches stress the crass reality of external fact. Third, existentialism is opposed to any form of necessitarianism; for existence is constituted by possibilities from among which the individual may choose and through which he can project himself. And, finally, with respect to the fourth point, existentialism is opposed to any solipsism (holding that I alone exist) or any epistemological idealism (holding that the objects of knowledge are mental), because existence, which is the relationship with other beings, always extends beyond itself, toward the being of those entities; it is, so to speak, transcendence. Starting from such bases, existentialism can take diverse and contrasting directions. It can insist on the transcendence of Being with respect to existence, and, by holding that transcendence to be the origin or foundation of existence, it can thus assume a theistic form. On the other hand, it can hold that human existence, posing itself as a problem, projects itself with absolute freedom, creating itself by itself, thus assuming to itself the function of God. As such, existentialism presents itself as a radical atheism. Or it may insist on the finitude of human existence i.e., on the limits inherent in its possibilities of projection and choice. As such, existentialism presents itself as a humanism. From 1940 on, with the diffusion of existentialism through continental Europe, its directions developed in keeping with the diversity of the interests to which they were subject: the religious interest, the metaphysical (or nature of Being) interest, and the moral and political interest. That diversity was rooted, at least in part, in the diversity of sources on which existentialism draws. One such source is the subjectivism of the 4 th 5 th - century theologian St. Augustine, who exhorted others not to go outside themselves in the quest for truth, for it is within them that truth abides. If you find that you are by nature mutable,  he wrote,  transcend yourself. Another source is the Dionysian Romanticism of the 19 th - century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who exalted life in its most irrational and cruel features and made such exaltation the proper task of the  higher man,  who exists beyond good and evil. Still another source is the nihilism of the Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky, who, in his novels, presented human beings as continually defeated as a result of their choices and as continually placed before the insoluble enigma of themselves. As a consequence of the diversity of such sources, existentialist doctrines focus on several aspects of existence. They focus, first, on the problematic character of the human situation, through which the individual is continually confronted with diverse possibilities or alternatives, among which he may choose and on the basis of which he can project his life. Second, the doctrines focus on the phenomena of that situation and especially on those that are negative or baffling, such as the concern or preoccupation that dominates the individual because of the dependence of all his possibilities upon his relationships with things and with other people; the dread of death or of the failure of his projects; the  shipwreck  upon insurmountable  limit situations  (death, the struggle and suffering inherent in every form of life, the situation in which everyone daily finds himself); the guilt inherent in the limitation of choices and in the responsibilities that derive from making them; the boredom from the repetition of situations; and the absurdity of his dangling between the infinity of his aspirations and the finitude of his possibilities. .student - promo - banner - wrapper   container - type: inline - size; margin - bottom: 15 px;    container (min - width: 475 px)   .student - promo - banner   flex - direction: row;   .student - promo - banner - img - wrapper   margin - bottom: 0; margin - right: 10 px; justify - content: flex - start;   .student - promo - banner - text - wrapper   text - align: left; margin - bottom: 0 px; margin - left: 10 px;   .student - promo - banner - button - wrapper   margin - right: 0;     Are you a student? Get a special academic rate on Britannica Premium. Subscribe Third, the doctrines focus on the intersubjectivity that is inherent in existence and is understood either as a personal relationship between two individuals, I and thou, such that the thou may be another person or God, or as an impersonal relationship between the anonymous mass and the individual self deprived of any authentic communication with others. Fourth, existentialism focuses on ontology, on some doctrine of the general meaning of Being, which can be approached in any of a number of ways: through the analysis of the temporal structure of existence; through the etymologies of the most common words on the supposition that in ordinary language Being itself is disclosed, at least partly (and thus is also hidden); through the rational clarification of existence by which it is possible to catch a glimpse, through ciphers or symbols, of the Being of the world, of the soul, and of God; through existential psychoanalysis that makes conscious the fundamental  project  in which existence consists; or, finally, through the analysis of the fundamental modality to which all the aspects of existence conform i.e., through the analysis of possibility. There is, in the fifth place, the therapeutic value of existential analysis that permits, on the one hand, the liberating of human existence from the beguilements or debasements to which it is subject in daily life and, on the other, the directing of human existence toward its authenticity i.e., toward a relationship that is well - grounded on itself, and with other humans, with the world, and with God. The various forms of existentialism may also be distinguished on the basis of language, which is an indication of the cultural traditions to which they belong and which often explains the differences in terminology among various authors. The principal representatives of German existentialism in the 20 th century were Martin Heidegger and Karl Jaspers; those of French personalistic existentialism were Gabriel Marcel and Jean - Paul Sartre; that of French phenomenology were Maurice Merleau - Ponty; that of Spanish existentialism was Jos  Ortega y Gasset; that of Russian idealistic existentialism was Nikolay Berdyayev (who, however, lived half of his adult life in France); and that of Italian existentialism was Nicola Abbagnano. The linguistic differences, however, are not decisive for a determination of philosophical affinities. For example, Marcel and Sartre were farther apart than Heidegger and Sartre; and there was greater affinity between Abbagnano and Merleau - Ponty than between Merleau - Ponty and Marcel.",

    "ai_overview": "Religious perspectives offer various interpretations of life's meaning:\n* **Foundation for a Journey to God:** Religion can provide a starting point by teaching prayer, moral living, and service, acting as a base for further spiritual learning.\n* **Kindergarten to Spirituality:** Religion serves as an initial stage, while true understanding requires progressing to the \"university of spirituality\" beyond religious boundaries.\n* **Hope After Death:** Some religious perspectives view life as a period of helplessness and suffering, compensated by eternal heaven after death. This belief can deter individuals from critical thinking and innovation.\n* **Source of Meaning:** Religion provides a powerful source of meaning in life by providing a sense of purpose, understanding, and psychological support.\n* **Meaning Systems:** Religious systems offer integrated beliefs, goals, and meanings to explain the world and deal with personal situations.\n* **Global Meaning:** Religion offers global meaning through comprehensiveness, accessibility, transcendence, and direct claims.\n* **Comprehensiveness:** Religion encompasses various sources of meaning, including social relationships, work, family and values.\n* **Accessibility:** Religions promote teachings, education, and ethical norms to contribute to global meaning.\n* **Transcendence:** Religions encourage the search for an ultimate authority and exploration of \"ultimate concerns.\"\n* **Direct Claims:** Religions directly provide significance by helping people interpret experiences through existential intentions.\n* **Coping with Stress:** Religion helps to cope with stress and major life events.\n* **Integrated Frameworks:** Individuals derive personal meaning from religious beliefs to cope with adversity.\n* **Influence on Coping:** Religious meanings may affect coping processes, and make meaning after loss.\n* **Positive Association:** Some aspects of religion have positive associations with a sense of meaning in life.\n* **Meaning in Life:** Religion makes people find life more valuable and more satisfying.",

PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC 4580713 PMID: 25524414 Abstract The purpose of this study was to examine whether meaning in life understood in terms of presence, search, and personal meaning is a mediator in the relationships between religious coping and psychological well - being. Associations of religiousness and psychological well - being are complex and suggest the existence of meaning and purpose in their internal structures. Two studies were conducted. In Study 1, presence of meaning in life was a mediator between negative coping and psychological well - being in the scope of a total score and all its dimensions. Search for meaning in life did not mediate the above relations. In Study 2, personal meaning turned out to be a partial mediator between negative coping and psychological well - being. These findings suggest that meaning in life is a crucial element of religious coping and psychological well - being that is used by people as a part of their meaning system to cope with life s difficulties and challenges. Keywords: Meaning in life, Religious coping, Psychological well - being, Purpose and significanceIntroduction Conceptualizing Meaning in Life One of the factors that affect human functioning is meaning in life. Many psychologists consider it to be a vital part of mental processes and behaviour (Frankl 1979; Steger 2012; Wong 1998). It enables individuals to interpret and organize their daily experience, achieve goals, and categorize important objects. Despite widespread agreement regarding the importance of meaning in life, defining it poses a challenge from both a theoretical and empirical point of view. Frankl (1965) in his theory of meaning proposed that each person has some unique purpose or overarching aim for their lives and tries to actualize as many values as possible in their community. Baumeister (1991) emphasizes that meaning in life depends on purpose, efficacy, value, and self - worth. Emmons (2003) defined meaning in terms of purpose and goals that are pursued by individuals. Other researchers describe meaning in life in terms of significance (Yalom 1980). People can experience meaning in life when their lives make sense or convey significant and comprehensible information. Analysing various approaches to meaning in life Steger (2009) defines meaning in life as  the extent to which people comprehend, make sense of, or see significance in their lives, accompanied by the degree to which they perceive themselves to have purpose, mission, or overarching aim in life  (p. 682). This definition is broad enough to encompass a wide range of human experiences related to purpose and significance and also suggests that people can find meaning by engaging in creative endeavours and pursuing their goals. Steger (2012) points out that meaning is a superordinate term that encompasses two main factors: comprehension and purpose. The first factor reflects the human ability to make sense of and understand one s life, including one s self, the external world, and how one fits with and operates within the world. The second factor denotes overarching and long - term life aspirations that are self - concordant and stimulate related activity. According to Steger et al. (2006), people s approach to understanding meaning in life can be viewed in two principal dimensions: presence of meaning in life and search for meaning in life. The former concerns the degree to which individuals perceive their lives as significant and meaningful. The latter reflects the degree to which people are engaged in a search for meaning in life. Both dimensions have an essentially different character and express dissimilar attitudes to life. Presence of meaning in life allows people to experience their lives as comprehensible and significant and feel a sense of purpose or mission in their lives that transcends the mundane concerns of daily life (Steger 2009). Search for meaning in life relates to the dynamic and active efforts individuals expend when they try to comprehend the meaning, significance, and purpose of their lives (Steger et al. 2008). Some researchers pointed out that searching for meaning is a basic human motivation (Frankl 1965), whereas others stressed the importance of the presence dimension (Reker 2005; Reker and Wong 1988). The presence of meaning in life approach was meticulously examined by Wong (1989) who defined meaning in life in the category of personal meaning as an individually constructed cognitive system, which endows life with personal significance. It can be conceived as a dynamic, cognitive map that directs people through their life course. According to Wong s (1998) implicit theories research, the meaning system consists of five components: affective, motivational, cognitive, relational, and personal. The categories are used to assess both self and life events in regard to meaning (McDonald et al. 2012). Personal meaning measures implicit meaning (i.e. conceptions and beliefs regarding life held by people) which is viewed as  comprising an ideally meaningful life . It assesses the level of meaning in seven domains: achievement (pursuit and attainment of significant life goals), relationship (general social adeptness), religion (having affirmative beliefs about relationships with the divine), self - transcendence (engagement in selfless pursuits), self - acceptance (a humble acceptance of one s limitations), intimacy (having emotionally close relationships), and fair treatment (perceiving a degree of justice in life). Relations Between Religion and Meaning in Life Many studies have been conducted which repeatedly show that religion can be a powerful source of meaning in life (Chamberlain and Zika 1992; Emmons 2005; Park 2005, 2013). Religion can be defined as  a search for meaning in ways related to the sacred  (Pargament 1997, p. 32). Despite the fact that the relationship between religion and meaning is intimate and complex, many people find in religious beliefs a sense of purpose, understanding, and psychological support (Park 2013). In their seminal book  The psychology of religion. An empirical approach , Hood et al. (2009) clearly state:  The assumptions forming the fundamental framework for this book are that the search for meaning is of central importance to human functioning, and that religion is uniquely capable of helping in that search  (p. 12). Religious systems provide individuals with an integrated set of beliefs, goals, and meanings which can be used in explaining intricacies of the world and dealing with personal situations and problems. Analysing religion as a provider of meaning, Hood et al. (2009) emphasize four criteria by which religion is uniquely capable of providing global meaning: comprehensiveness, accessibility, transcendence, and direct claims. First, religion is the most comprehensive of all meaning systems, because it includes an extensive range of other sources of meaning, such as social relationships, work, family, achievement, personal relationships, and important values. Religion is accessible to people in the sense of contributing to global meaning through promoting doctrinal teachings and creeds, religious education, and ethical norms of acceptable and unacceptable behaviours. The next criterion: transcendence reflects people s tendency to search for an invisible reality and explore  ultimate concerns  (Emmons 2005) which requires some belief in an ultimate authority in which higher meaning is found. Finally, religion makes direct claims to provide a sense of significance as it facilitates people s efforts to interpret their experiences in terms of existential intentions and meaning which is embedded within religion s sacred character. The ability of religion to provide meaning in life is particularly noticeable in the context of coping with stress and major life events. Religious coping can be defined in terms of  the degree to which religion is a part of the process of understanding and dealing with critical life events  (Pargament et al. 2005, p. 482). The results of studies conducted by Pargament (1997) who introduced the concept of religious coping reveal that it can be helpful or harmful, depending upon the particular type of religious coping strategy employed. In general, religious coping methods can be grouped into two wide overarching categories: positive and negative religious coping (Pargament et al. 1998). Positive religious coping styles relate to secure relationships with God and a sense of spiritual connectedness with others. They tend to be more beneficial for people who experience stressful events. Negative religious coping styles reveal insecure relationships with God and strains between individuals, and as research indicates, they are usually maladaptive (Ano and Vasconcelles 2005; Pargament et al. 2004). In that sense, religion is more than a defence mechanism as it can provide individuals with comprehensive and integrated frameworks of meaning that enable them to explain difficult life occurrences in satisfactory way. Research carried out by Park (2005) on bereaved college students shows that religious meaning may affect coping processes by making meaning after the loss of a loved one. In the initial period of mourning, people who had strong religious beliefs tended to experience more stress, which was linked to the discrepancy between their global meaning system and appraisals of such events. However, after a period of a few months, these effects disappeared or even reversed, suggesting a positive association between religion and long - term adjustment. Drawing on religion as a meaning system, studies show that individuals can derive comprehensive frameworks of personal meaning from their religious beliefs which in turn influence their abilities to cope with adversity and life stress (Park 2007, 2013). Some aspects of religion, especially intrinsic religiousness, appear to be positively associated with a sense of meaning in life (Ardelt 2003; Chamberlain and Zika 1992; Steger and Frazier 2005). Meaning in Life as an Important Factor for Well - Being There is substantial evidence demonstrating that meaning in life is associated with well - being and positive functioning. People who believe that their lives have meaning are happier (Debats et al. 1993) and report a higher level of life satisfaction which reflects the degree to which individuals positively evaluate their lives (Chamberlain and Zika 1988; Steger et al. 2008). Studies have also confirmed links between meaning in life and various measures of global happiness (Ryff and Keyes 1995), psychological adjustment (Thompson et al. 2003), and general well - being (Ho et al. 2010). The results provide strong evidence that validates positive relations between meaning in life and domains reflecting positive functioning. Meaning of life is also associated with positive affect and emotions which are often regarded as an emotional dimension of subjective well - being (Diener 2009). People reporting high levels of meaning tend to experience stronger positive affect (King et al. 2006) and less negative affect (Chamberlain and Zika 1988), depression and anxiety (Debats et al. 1993). In his meta - analysis, Pinquart (2002) concludes that the correlation between meaning in life and positive affect is .47. King and Hicks (2013) note that those correlations range from .45 between positive affect and a composite of PIL and SOC questionnaires (in a sample of 586 undergraduates) to .80 for positive affect and SOC (in a sample of 266 community adults). A very promising area of research on meaning in life and well - being lies within the model of psychological well - being (PWB) that is explicitly concerned with the development and self - realization of the individual (Ryff 1989; Ryff and Keyes 1995). PWB has been defined as  engagement with existential challenges of life  (Keyes et al. 2002, p. 1007) and is arguably best represented by Ryff s (1989) PWB model. The PWB model is based on a eudaimonic approach that perceives life in terms of virtue defined as finding the middle ground between excess and deficiency and conditioned upon self - truth and self - responsibility (Ryff and Singer 2008). According to Ryff (1989), this model of well - being includes six constructs: (1) self - acceptance, (2) positive relations with others, (3) autonomy, (4) environmental mastery, (5) purpose in life (PIL), and (6) personal growth. Taken together, they offer a multidimensional, eudaimonic vision of human life. Research on PWB shows that it is associated with more optimal human functioning and health benefits (Ryff and Singer 2008) and a stronger sense of coherence (Krok 2010). There were also found positive associations between meaning in life and PWB, suggesting that a sense of purpose and significance is related to personal development and self - realization (Krok 2011). Direct and Indirect Relations Between Religion and Well - Being A growing body of research indicates that religion is linked to well - being. Studies conducted in many countries confirmed positive associations between religiousness and general well - being (Delbridge et al. 1994; Green and Elliott 2010; Silberman 2005). The connections were particularly observable among older adults (McFadden 1995), which supports the assumption that this category of people can rely more on religion as a source of comfort and significance. Examining the associations between religiousness and individual and communal well - being, Myers (2008) points out that actively religious individuals report distinctly greater happiness and life satisfaction in comparison with their non - religious counterparts. However, Diener and Clifton (2002) noticed that the results of large - scale surveys pointing to relations between various aspects of religiousness and well - being are quite modest. According to their findings, the correlation between religiousness and life satisfaction is rather small (r   .08) and between religiousness and happiness equals r   .06. In order to explain this consistent positive correlation between religiousness and well - being, some researchers proposed that the relation can be mediated by such factors as meaning in life (Chamberlain and Zika 1992), social support and optimism (Salsman et al. 2005), and prosocial behaviour (Kim 2003). Others suggested that religiousness incorporating a sense of purpose and significance may lead to the assignment of more positive meanings to ordinary daily events, which may, in turn, generate positive emotions related to religious experiences (Park 2013). Empirical evidence confirms this assumption. Chamberlain and Zika (1992) found that the association between religion and well - being is mediated by an enhanced sense of meaning in life. Examining effects of religion and PIL on older adults, Ardelt (2003) revealed that intrinsic religious orientation and religious involvement have an indirect effect, mediated by PIL, on subjective well - being. Intrinsically religious older people who have found a sense of meaning and PIL were more likely to participate frequently in spiritual activities with others and to belong to a religious group than were extrinsically religious people. Results obtained by Steger and Frazier (2005) demonstrated that meaning in life mediated the relation between religiousness and well - being in a university student sample when well - being was assessed by life satisfaction and self - esteem. In addition, meaning in life turned out to be an important mediator of the relation between daily religious activity and well - being, which can suggest that religious individuals might feel greater well - being because they derive meaning in life from their religious feelings and activities. Krok (2010) confirmed a mediational role of meaning in life in relations between religious meaning system and PWB. However, research has not been conducted that would investigate relations between religious coping and PWB which could reveal more precisely the nature and mechanisms relating religion to well - being. The evidence from the above studies indicates that in the context of other potential mediators between religiousness and well - being, meaning in life appears very promising. Yet, examination of measures of meaning in life reveals that these scales often refer to diverse dimensions and are based on different premises. Some of them assume that daily life itself may be assessed with regard to meaning  e.g. the PIL, Crumbaugh and Maholick 1964 and the Personal Meaning Profile (PMP), Wong 1998 , while others evaluate meaning in life in terms of both presence and search (Steger et al. 2006). Thus, meaning in life is not simply a one - dimensional, global judgment made about a life as a whole but a construct that encompasses more dimensions. It needs to be examined from different perspectives if we want to discover the complexities of meaningful life and find variables associated with daily meaning in life. Overview of Studies In the present study, we decided to examine meaning in life as a factor that can explain the relation between religious coping and PWB. First, we wanted to investigate more deeply relationships between religious coping and PWB which expand our knowledge about the ways in which people rely on their religious beliefs and activities in building existential life satisfaction and forming a global judgment of a well - lived life. People use their religion in order to discover the deeper truths and mysteries in life and to understand what makes their life valuable. Second, because meaning in life was analysed in the perspectives of both presence and search (Study 1), and personal meaning (Study 2), it allows us to investigate its different dimensions and their mediational effects between religious coping and PWB. Meaning in life is often portrayed as emerging out of motivation. Therefore, the question of whether its dimensions play a role in mediating relations between the forms of coping based on religious experiences and well - being ingrained in existential challenges of life appears very important. Finally, we wanted to assess which dimensions of meaning in life are most associated with PWB. It is very likely that when individuals have a view of life as personally significant and purposeful, they ought to experience their life as valued and self - fulfilled. Study 1 In Study 1, we examined how positive and negative religious coping related to meaning in life and PWB. Then, we used multiple regression and mediational tests to assess the degree to which presence of and search for meaning in life mediated the relation between the two ways of religious coping and PWB. We used PWB as an outcome measure because it has received considerable research attention and occupies a prominent place in theories of eudaimonic well - being (Ong and Zautra 2009). The study focused on the following hypotheses: (1) endorsement of religious coping styles will be differently correlated with individuals  meaning in life. That is, positive coping will show positive associations with meaning in life, whereas negative coping will correlate negatively with meaning in life; (2) there will be associations between religious coping and PWB; (3) presence of meaning in life will be a stronger mediator between religious coping and PWB than search for meaning in life. Method Participants A total of 187 participants (97 women and 90 men) completed a questionnaire packet consisting of three methods. Ages ranged from 19 to 62, with a mean age of 30 years (SD   9.45). There were no statistically significant differences in terms of age between women and men. The vast majority of participants were Christians (91.8  ), with only 8.2   describing themselves as non - believers (who nevertheless occasionally used religious coping strategies). The study was anonymous. Measures and Procedure Three psychological tests were administered: Brief RCOPE, the Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ) and the Psychological Well - Being Scale (PWB). All of them were Polish versions. Brief RCOPE is a 14 - item questionnaire that assesses the extent to which the person uses specific methods of religious coping (Pargament et al. 1998). It consists of two subscales: (1) positive religious coping that measures seeking spiritual support, seeking a spiritual connection, collaboration with God in problem solving, religious forgiveness, and benevolent religious appraisals of illness; and (2) negative religious coping that assesses punishing God appraisals, interpersonal religious discontent, demonic appraisals, spiritual discontent, and questioning God s powers. People indicate how often they engage in each form of religious coping on a 4 - point scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (a lot). This instrument has demonstrated good construct validity and internal consistency in the Polish version (Jarosz 2011). The MLQ was developed by Steger et al. (2006) to assess two dimensions of meaning in life: presence and search. It consists of 10 items rated on a 7 - point scale from 1 (absolutely untrue) to 7 (absolutely true). The presence subscale measures the extent to which participants perceive their lives as meaningful (e.g. I understand my life s meaning  and  My life has no clear purpose ). The search subscale measures the extent to which respondents are actively seeking meaning or purpose in their lives (e.g. I am searching for meaning in my life  and  I am looking for something that makes my life feel meaningful ). The MLQ Polish version adapted by Krok (2011) was used. The PWB scale is a 42 - item questionnaire that evaluates the level of individuals  development and self - realization (Ryff and Keyes 1995). It comprises six scales: autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, PIL, and self - acceptance. Each scale consists of seven items, with a mix of positive and negative items. On a scale from 1 to 6, respondents indicated whether they agreed or disagreed strongly, moderately, or slightly that an item described how they thought and felt. As in Sheldon and Lyubomirsky s (2006) study, a total PWB score can be calculated by adding all the six dimensions. The Polish version was adapted by Krok (2010). Those who agreed to participate in the study completed a questionnaire packet containing demographic items, measures of religious coping, meaning in life, and PWB. The participants either returned the completed questionnaires directly or sent them back by post. Results and Discussion As an initial examination of the predicted relations, correlations were computed among religious coping, meaning in life, and PWB, and these are shown in Table 1. Table 1.

Negative coping was negatively correlated with presence, but not with search. As regards relations between religious coping and PWB, there were no significant associations between positive coping and dimensions of PWB and its total score. However, negative correlations were found between negative coping and all the dimensions of PWB: autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, PIL, and self - acceptance. A different view concerns relations between meaning in life and PWB. Positive associations were found between presence and all the dimensions of PWB and the total score. In contrast, there were only two statistically significant correlations between search and subscales of PWB search positively correlated with personal growth and positive relations with others. No correlation was found between search and the total PWB score. In the next step, multiple regression was used to assess mediational effects for religious coping, meaning in life and PWB (Fig. 1). We first established that the conditions for mediation were met (Baron and Kenny 1986). There was no significant association between positive coping and the total score of PWB which invalidates further statistical analyses. However, negative coping was negatively related to PWB which satisfies the first requirement (     .42; p   .001). Fulfilling the second requirement, negative coping was also related to presence of meaning (     .23; p   .01). Satisfying the third requirement, presence was related to PWB, controlling for negative coping (    .39; p   .001). The next requirement was that the relation between negative coping and PWB be significantly smaller, with presence entered as a predictor. However, the relation between negative coping and PWB decreased (from  .42 to  .32), although it remained significant. The Sobel test was significant (z    4.30; p   .001). Presence of meaning seemed thus to be a partial mediator of the relation between negative coping and PWB. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Presence of meaning as mediating the association between negative coping and psychological well - beingThe mediational effects of presence were also statistically significant for the associations between negative coping and all the dimensions of PWB: autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, PIL, and self - acceptance. The Sobel test results confirmed that presence was a partial mediator between negative coping and the dimensions of psychological well - being. The results of the further analyses did not allow for testing search for meaning in life as a mediator, because there was no significant association between negative coping and search (     .06; p   .423). In summary, the results obtained in Study 1 indicate that religious coping is associated with meaning in life. Positive coping positively correlated with both dimensions of meaning in life: presence and search, whereas negative coping was only negatively linked with presence. The results confirmed the first hypothesis showing that religiousness understood in terms of coping styles relates to a sense of purpose and significance. Only negative coping was related negatively to PWB in the scope of the total score and all the dimensions: autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, PIL, and self - acceptance. It allows us to partially verify the second hypothesis indicating associations between religious coping and PWB. The associations only occur in the negative forms of religious coping. The main result of Study 1 was revealing presence of meaning in life as a mediator between negative coping and PWB in the scope of a total score and all its dimensions. However, meaning only partially mediated the above relation which suggests that people s expectations for significance and purpose in the future cannot be explained completely by religion s contribution to their meaning in life. This view was supported by the fact that search for meaning in life did not mediate the relation between religious coping and PWB. The third hypothesis was thus partially confirmed. The results provide support for the mediational role of presence of meaning in life in the relation between religious coping and PWB. Yet, one limitation of this study was that the measure of presence of meaning in life was assessed in only one dimension. Therefore, using a more refined measure of presence appears reasonable and fully justified. In Study 2, we sought to continue to examine the relations between religious coping and PWB by using a multidimensional measure of meaning in life which also has a slightly different character. Study 2 The implications of Study 1 are limited by the use of only the one - dimensional presence of meaning, while research suggests that meaning in life can consist of more dimensions (Reker 2005; Wong 1998). Therefore, in Study 2, we sought to expand the assessment of relations between religious coping and PWB by including personal meaning that is based on an implicit theories approach and regarded as  comprising an ideally meaningful life  (Wong 1998). It presents meaning in life in seven domains: achievement, relationship, religion, self - transcendence, self - acceptance, intimacy, and fair treatment. Consistent with the meaning - as - mediator model, we hypothesized that personal meaning would mediate the relation between religious coping and PWB. Method Participants One hundred and eighty - two participants (94 women and 88 men) were given a questionnaire packet consisting of three methods. Ages ranged from 21 to 63, with a mean age of 41 years (SD   10.21). There were no statistically significant differences in terms of age between women and men. The vast majority of participants were Christians (92.3  ), and only 7.7   described themselves as non - believers. The participants represented different professions and came from both urban and rural environments. The study was anonymous. Measures Three psychological tests were administered: Brief RCOPE, the PWB scale and the PMP. All of them were Polish versions. The first two scales were described in Study 1. The PMP (Wong 1998) measures implicit meaning that is viewed as  comprising an ideally meaningful life . The scale assesses the level of meaning reported by respondents in seven domains: achievement, relationship, religion, self - transcendence, self - acceptance, intimacy, and fair treatment. A total score can also be calculated to reflect overall levels of personal meaning. The Polish version was adapted by Krok (2010). Results and Discussion In the initial examination of the predicted relations, correlations were calculated among religious coping, dimensions of personal meaning, and a total score of PWB, and these are shown in Table 2.

On the contrary, negative coping was negatively associated with personal meaning and all its dimensions except religion. The last result was rather surprising if we take into account opposite directions between positive and negative coping. PWB positively correlated with personal meaning and all its dimensions. In order to examine more thoroughly relations between personal meaning and PWB, correlations were run between their dimensions. The results are presented in Table 3. Table 3.

The only associations which were insignificant occurred between relationship and autonomy, religion and both autonomy and environmental mastery, fair treatment and autonomy. All the other relations were significant and positive. In a similar way as in Study 1, we again used multiple regression to test whether personal meaning (total score) mediated the relation between religious coping and PWB. To assess whether the conditions for mediation were met, we separately assessed each necessary relation (Baron and Kenny 1986). No significant association was found between positive coping and the total score of PWB (    .08; p   .26) which does not allow further statistical analyses. However, negative coping was negatively related to PWB which meets the first requirement (     .41; p   .001) (Fig. 2). Satisfying the second requirement, negative coping was also related to personal meaning (     .24; p   .001). According to the third requirement, personal meaning was related to PWB, controlling for negative coping (    .46; p   .001). Regarding the fourth requirement of mediation, negative coping was still significantly related to PWB (     .31; p   .001) when personal meaning was added to the model. The relation between negative coping and PWB decreased (from  .41 to  .31), although it remained significant. Next, a Sobel test was performed to determine whether personal meaning partially mediated the relation between negative coping and PWB. The Sobel test was significant (z    2.95; p   .003), indicating that personal meaning is a partial mediator accounting for at least a portion of the relation between negative coping and PWB. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Personal meaning as mediating the association between negative coping and psychological well - beingIn order to examine further mediational effects, we conducted statistical analyses for the associations between negative coping and PWB with all the personal meaning dimensions as mediating variables. The results showed that the following dimensions: achievement, relationship, self - transcendence, self - acceptance, intimacy, and fair treatment met the statistical requirements (regressions and a Sobel test) for mediation and were partial mediators in the relations between negative coping and PWB. Religion was the only factor that did not satisfy mediational requirements. The results obtained in this study fit with the previous ones. Religious coping styles were associated with personal meaning. Positive correlations were found between positive coping and personal meaning and negative correlations between negative coping and personal meaning. All the dimensions of personal meaning showed positive links with PWB. The mediational analyses revealed that personal meaning was a partial mediator between negative coping and PWB which confirms our predictions. In line with results from the previous study, this finding added strong support for the hypothesis that presence of meaning in life is an important partial mediator of the relation between religious coping and PWB, but only for the form of coping which is based on negative appraisals and accusatory attitudes towards God. General Discussion The aim of the studies was to empirically test assumptions that meaning in life may be a mediator in the relation between religious coping and PWB. In addition, we wanted to assess relationships between religious coping, meaning in life, and PWB. These questions were examined by using different indices of meaning in life: presence, search, and personal meaning which enabled us to understand more deeply how individuals form a meaningful life and approach a domain of significance and purpose. The results indicate that these relations exist which has potentially important implications. Mediational analyses revealed that presence of meaning in life is a partial mediator of the relation between negative religious coping and PWB. Several previous studies implied that meaning in life was a mediator between religion and well - being (Chamberlain and Zika 1992), intrinsic religious orientation and subjective well - being (Ardelt 2003), and religiousness and life satisfaction (Steger and Frazier 2005). The evidence from the present studies indicates that meaning in life plays a mediational role between a negative form of religious coping and PWB. Taken together, these results demonstrate that meaning in life is an important element of religion that imbues religious behaviour with a sense of purpose and significance. It is especially noticeable in the context of religious coping that is strongly connected to the domain of meaning (Pargament et al. 2004; Park 2005, 2013). Approaching challenging and problematic life circumstances, individuals draw on the orienting system of religion and meaning through which they interpret and handle stressful situations. Religious coping methods are used to strengthen other non - religious psychological resources to enable people to face life challenges. There are two questions that can arise in the context of the current research: why presence of meaning in life turned out to be a partial mediator and why only negative coping was related to PWB. According to recent research, meaning is a central element of religion because every religion addresses important questions related to a sense of purpose and significance (Hood et al. 2009; Park 2013). People turn to religious beliefs and activities in order to find meaning in complex and incomprehensible events. Religious interpretations enable individuals to perceive daily experiences in terms of universal goals and provide explanations for situations of high ambiguity and threat. Therefore, religion is inseparably interconnected with meaning on both the structural and functional levels. As a result, meaning in life only partially mediates the relation between religious coping and PWB mainly because the religious realm is already imbued with meaning. Analyses of the question why only negative religious coping was related to PWB need to take into account the fact that the relation had a negative character. The less individuals use negative coping strategies, the more their level of PWB increases. This result can suggest that avoidance of negative religious coping strategies such as punishing God appraisals, interpersonal religious discontent, or questioning God s powers is beneficial for one s PWB. When facing stressful situations, people rely on a system of religious beliefs, practices, and relationships which affects the ways in which they deal with difficult situations (Pargament 1997). This religious orienting system is translated into concrete situation - specific appraisals which are used to gain or search for a sense of significance. The process enables people to find meaning which, in turn, increases their PWB. The results of this study also deepen our understanding of the function of religion in both human life as a whole and creating well - being. Previous studies have established that religion is linked to subjective well - being and that meaning in life mediates their relations (Chamberlain and Zika 1992; Krok 2010; Steger and Frazier 2005). The current research showed that religious coping is moderately related to PWB and that meaning in life is a partial mediator in the relation between both factors. These moderate relationships can imply that people do not primarily engage in religious activities to elevate subjective or PWB. Religion contributes to well - being by providing individuals with a sense of meaning, but the main function of religion is to bring people into greater contact with sacred matters, rather than maximizing happiness or self - fulfilment. The findings also provide evidence that meaning in life is a crucial element of religious coping and PWB. People use religious beliefs, feelings, and practices as a part of their meaning system to cope with life s difficulties and challenges (Pargament et al. 2005; Park 2005). The links existing between religious coping and meaning in life suggest that religion can influence many aspects of meaning by providing an ultimate motivation to all aspects of a person s life, establishing goals and value systems and helping to instil a deeper sense of meaning in life. It is unquestionably evident within a framework of the meaning making model proposed by Park (2013), which posits that religious and spiritual factors play an important role in modelling the meaning system of many individuals. Meaning in life appears instrumental in creating PWB. It mainly refers to the dimensions of presence and personal meaning, but not search which did not have any associations with PWB apart from its two dimensions: personal growth and positive relations with others. The results imply that existential convictions regarding a sense of significance and purpose help individuals to attain higher levels of PWB in the domain of autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, and self - acceptance. They also appear to reflect a noticeably human characteristic of striving for meaning in life as a way of increasing the form of well - being that is based on values and engaged with existential challenges of life. People struggle to explore important areas of their life through personal goal systems and PIL. The present study certainly has limitations which warrant discussion. First, religiousness was only assessed in terms of religious coping which is the degree to which religion is helpful in understanding and dealing with critical life events. Replication of the current results with other measures of religiousness would reveal the associations of other domains of religion (e.g. specific religious beliefs, emotions, or activities) with PWB and broaden our understanding of which factors are most important in those relations. Second, the current work relied wholly on self - report measures of meaning in life. Although it has been the most popular method of measuring this factor, it does not tap the full range of individual differences regarding a sense of purpose and significance (Reker 2005; Steger 2009). Future research could employ experimental procedures of assessing meaning in life. Procedures consisting in inducing thoughts or feelings related to the domain of meaning would enable researchers to formulate more precise causal relations and understand how meaning can change under the influence of various factors. Thirdly, the assessment was done once at a given time which limits chances of investigating potential changes in meaning in life. Introducing longitudinal methods of evaluations e.g. asking participants to keep a diary of meaningful events for a longer time (i.e. a month or even more) would more precisely divulge the process by which meaning is created from life experiences. A final limitation of the present study is that the samples were mainly composed of Christians. It was a consequence of the specific character of the examined population (Poland) in which a vast majority of the people are Christians. Hence, the findings may not generalize to other populations which include other religions. Despite its limitations, the current study provides evident support for the hypotheses that meaning in life is a partial mediator through which religious coping is associated with PWB and that presence of meaning in life is strongly linked with well - being based on a eudaimonic approach. The programme of two studies reported here lays a strong foundation for further research exploring the role of meaning in life and other related factors in fostering well - being, as well as applying the literature on religion, meaning, and PWB to important human problems.

    "ai_overview": "Religious perspectives offer various interpretations of life's meaning:\n* **Foundation for a Journey to God:** Religion can provide a starting point by teaching prayer, moral living, and service, acting as a base for further spiritual learning.\n* **Kindergarten to Spirituality:** Religion serves as an initial stage, while true understanding requires progressing to the \"university of spirituality\" beyond religious boundaries.\n* **Hope After Death:** Some religious perspectives view life as a period of helplessness and suffering, compensated by eternal heaven after death. This belief can deter individuals from critical thinking and innovation.\n* **Source of Meaning:** Religion provides a powerful source of meaning in life by providing a sense of purpose, understanding, and psychological support.\n* **Meaning Systems:** Religious systems offer integrated beliefs, goals, and meanings to explain the world and deal with personal situations.\n* **Global Meaning:** Religion offers global meaning through comprehensiveness, accessibility, transcendence, and direct claims.\n* **Comprehensiveness:** Religion encompasses various sources of meaning, including social relationships, work, family and values.\n* **Accessibility:** Religions promote teachings, education, and ethical norms to contribute to global meaning.\n* **Transcendence:** Religions encourage the search for an ultimate authority and exploration of \"ultimate concerns.\"\n* **Direct Claims:** Religions directly provide significance by helping people interpret experiences through existential intentions.\n* **Coping with Stress:** Religion helps to cope with stress and major life events.\n* **Integrated Frameworks:** Individuals derive personal meaning from religious beliefs to cope with adversity.\n* **Influence on Coping:** Religious meanings may affect coping processes, and make meaning after loss.\n* **Positive Association:** Some aspects of religion have positive associations with a sense of meaning in life.\n* **Meaning in Life:** Religion makes people find life more valuable and more satisfying.",

Research design A sample of 481 chronically ill patients (M   50 years, SD   7.26) completed measures on meaning in life, life satisfaction, optimism, and acceptance. We hypothesized that Presence of Meaning and Search for Meaning will have specific relations with all 3 aspects of well - being. Results Cluster analysis was used to examine meaning in life profiles. Results supported 4 distinguishable profiles (High Presence High Search, Low Presence High Search, High Presence Low Search, and Low Presence Low Search) with specific patterns in relation to well - being and acceptance. Specifically, the 2 profiles in which meaning is present showed higher levels of well - being and acceptance, whereas the profiles in which meaning is absent are characterized by lower levels. Furthermore, the results provided some clarification on the nature of the Search for Meaning process by distinguishing between adaptive (the High Presence High Search cluster) and maladaptive (the Low Presence High Search cluster) searching for meaning in life. Conclusions The present study provides an initial glimpse in how meaning in life may be related to the well - being of chronically ill patients and the acceptance of their condition. Clinical implications are discussed. Keywords: acceptance, chronic illness, cluster analysis, meaning in life, well - beingIntroduction Researchers and clinicians are clarifying the factors in constructive coping among chronically ill individuals. Understanding this process is a crucial step toward interventions that stimulate well - being and life quality. Previous research has shown that adaptation to a chronic condition requires individuals to revise one's life goals and expectations, given that serious illness often crosses valued goals and life plans (Pinquart, Silbereisen,   Frohlich, 2009). Such a profound revision of one's life often raises disquieting questions of meaning in life. Meaning in life refers to people's concerns with the core significance and purpose of their personal existence. Indeed, concerns about life's meaning are especially salient for individuals coping with significant medical stressors (Dezutter, 2010; Sherman   Simonton, 2012). Although several theories have been put forth on the role of meaning in life when coping with severe life stressors (e.g., Frankl, 1963; Janoff - Bulman, 2004; Yalom, 1980), only recently has empirical research explored this domain (for an overview, see Park, 2010). Research in healthy populations showed meaning in life to be an important factor in optimal functioning. Meaning in life, for example, has been positively associated with psychological well - being in healthy adolescents (Brassai, Piko,   Steger, 2011) and adults (Steger, Kawabata, Shimai,   Otake, 2008; Zika   Chamberlain, 1992). Furthermore, meaning in life seemed to be inversely related to depression (e.g., Debats, 1996; Mascaro   Rosen, 2005). Recently, there is some evidence that those who find meaning in life may be better able to cope with medical challenges. In a sample of individuals living with spinal cord injury, meaning in life was related with higher psychological well - being (DeRoon - Cassini et al., 2009). Similarly, cancer patients with higher meaning in life reported improved quality - of - life (Sherman, Simonton, Latif,   Bracy, 2010), higher well - being (Park, Edmondson, Fenster,   Blank, 2008), and lower levels of depressive symptoms and fatigue (Yanez et al., 2009). Presence of Meaning and Search for Meaning Although preliminary evidence shows that meaning in life may influence health, current research is often limited by conceptual concerns (Sherman   Simonton, 2012; Sherman et al., 2010). The multidimensional character of the concept resulted in a multitude of research tapping into different aspects of the construct (for a review, see Morgan   Farsides, 2009). Steger and colleagues made a successful attempt to remedy this lack of conceptual clarity by distinguishing between two components of meaning in life (Steger, Frazier, Oishi,   Kaler, 2006). The first aspect, Presence of Meaning, indicates whether individuals perceive their lives as significant and purposeful. The term refers to the comprehension of oneself and the surrounding world, including the understanding of how one fits into the world (King, Hicks, Krull,   Del Gaiso, 2006; Steger, Kashdan, Sullivan,   Lorentz, 2008). The second aspect, Search for Meaning, refers to the strength, intensity, and activity of people's efforts to establish or increase their understanding of the meaning and purpose of their lives ( how can I make my life more meaningful? ; Steger, Kashdan et al., 2008). In sum, whereas the Presence of Meaning dimension implies some kind of outcome, the Search for Meaning dimension refers to an active and process - oriented factor. Empirical studies on meaning in life and medical stressors focus predominantly on the component of Presence of Meaning (e.g., Sherman et al., 2010; DeRoon - Cassini et al., 2009) with limited attention toward the dimension of Search for Meaning (Cohen   Cairns, 2012). Available research, however, has found unique correlates associated with these two components, suggesting that both play a distinct role in individual's psychological functioning. More specifically, Presence of Meaning has been found to be positively associated with psychological well - being, whereas the associations between Search for Meaning and psychosocial functioning are less clear (Steger, 2012). Further, meaning in life research is often conducted within a variable - centered perspective, focusing on Presence of Meaning or Search for Meaning, but not on how these variables relate to each other (Magnusson, 1985). A person - oriented approach can complement the existing variable - oriented literature by identifying naturally occurring patterns among variables (Bergman   Magnusson, 1997; Scholte, van Lieshout, de Wit,   van Aken, 2005). Two recent studies in healthy populations highlight the need to study the within - person interaction between Search for Meaning and Presence of Meaning by demonstrating that searching for meaning has distinct consequences for individuals who have high levels of presence of meaning compared to those individuals having low levels of presence of meaning (Cohen   Cairns, 2012; Dezutter et al., 2013). Both studies showed that if individuals both experience meaning and search for it, presence of meaning seems to buffer for the negative impact of searching for meaning. These studies focus on healthy individuals' well - being, but it is unknown how these meaning in life dimensions interact among chronically ill patients for whom topics regarding life meaningfulness are probably more salient and may have greater impact on mental and physical health. Current Study The present study focused on Searching and Presence of meaning in life as factors that might affect psychological well - being of chronically ill patients, and we opted for a person - oriented approach (i.e., cluster analysis). Because of the lack of prior research on meaning in life typologies in chronically ill patients, our research was largely exploratory to provide the basis for future hypothesis - driven research. However, based on one previous study clustering Presence of Meaning and Search for Meaning in a healthy population (Dezutter et al., 2013), we expected at least four clusters to emerge: a) a cluster consisting of patients who experience high levels of meaning without searching for meaning (High Presence Low Search); (b) a cluster with the opposite profile consisting of patients who report low levels of meaning and who are searching for meaning (Low Presence High Search); (c) a cluster consisting of patients high on search for meaning and high on presence of meaning (High Presence High Search); and (d) a cluster consisting of patients low on both search for meaning and presence of meaning (Low Presence Low Search). Based on earlier research pointing to the benevolent role of experiencing meaning in life, we anticipated that clusters characterized by higher levels of Presence of Meaning would be characterized by greater levels of well - being (e.g., Yanez et al., 2009) whereas the opposite was expected for clusters characterized by lower levels of Presence of Meaning. Furthermore, we hypothesized that high levels of Search for Meaning, combined with low levels of Presence of Meaning might indicate a stressful search, as reflected in lower levels of well - being. On the other hand, high levels of Search for Meaning combined with high levels of Presence might indicate an adaptive search (Frankl, 1963), as reflected in higher levels of well - being (graphical overview in Table 1).

Participants were registered in the database of the Dutch National Health Service as chronically ill persons and received an official  chronic disease  diagnosis by a medical doctor of the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (RIZIV). The RIZIV follows the guidelines of the World Health Organization and describes chronic diseases as diseases of long duration, namely longer than 6 months, and with a slow progression. Most frequent chronic diseases in Belgium are low back pain, arthritis, neck pain, and chronic headaches (Paulus, Van Den Heede,   Mertens, 2012). Because of privacy reasons, researchers were not allowed to have access to diagnosis information. One thousand five hundred six randomly selected chronic ill patients received an invitation to fill out an enclosed questionnaire. Randomization was performed by inviting every tenth person in the Ziekenzorg CM database for collaboration in the study. Five hundred twenty - eight patients consented (response rate 29 ), and 481 usable questionnaires were obtained. Anonymity was guaranteed, and the Board of the Ziekenzorg CM and of IKKS reviewed and approved the study. The sample consisted of 481 patients diagnosed by the RIZIV as patients with a chronic disease. Demographically, the sample was 68  women and mean age was 50 years (SD   7.26, range 26   65). Average duration of the chronic condition was 12 years (SD   10.70, range 1   59). Sociodemographic information and description of disability can be found in Table 2. Table 2.

One subscale taps into Presence of Meaning (Cronbach's alpha   .84, e.g., I understand my life's meaning) and one into Search for Meaning (Cronbach's alpha   .85, e.g., I am always looking to find my life's purpose). Life satisfaction The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS, Diener, Emmons, Larsen,   Griffin, 1985) is a short, 5 - item instrument designed to measure global cognitive judgments of one's life. Participants rated the items on a 5 - point scale ranging from 1   strongly disagree to 7   strongly agree (e.g., If I could live my life over, I would change almost nothing). Cronbach's alpha for this sample was .86. Acceptance Acceptance of chronic disease is measured with a single item (I have accepted my chronic disease) rated on a 5 - point scale ranging from 1   strongly disagree to 5   strongly agree. Optimism Optimism is measured with a single item (I have a positive outlook in life) rated on a 5 - point scale ranging from 1   strongly disagree to 5   strongly agree. Data Analysis Correlational analyses (SPSS 19.0) were performed to test the relationships between the study variables. Confirmatory factor analysis (Mplus 6, Muth n   Muth n, 2010) is performed to test the presence of a higher order latent 'well - being' factor based on the manifest scores of life satisfaction, acceptance, and optimism. Cluster analysis (SPSS 19.0) is performed to investigate natural occurring profiles of the meaning in life dimensions. Cluster analyses were conducted on the dimensions of Presence of Meaning and Search for Meaning. Scores were standardized in z scores within the total sample, and only standardized scores were used for cluster analyses. In the first step, a hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out using Ward's method and squared Euclidian distances (Steinley   Brusco, 2007). In the second step, the cluster centers from this hierarchical analysis were used as nonrandom starting points in a noniterative k - means clustering procedure (Breckenridge, 2000). This two - step procedure remedies one of the major shortcoming of the hierarchical method, namely that once a case is clustered, it cannot be reassigned to another cluster at a subsequent stage. k - means clustering, however, minimizes within - cluster variability and maximizes between - cluster variability, allowing reassignments to  better fitting  clusters and thus optimizing cluster membership (Gore, 2000). Finally, multivariate analyses (SPSS 19.0) were performed to test for cluster differences in well - being. Results Preliminary Analyses All correlations among the study variables are presented in Table 3. Age and illness duration were unrelated to the study variables, except for a negative significant correlation between age and satisfaction in life (r    .19, p   .001). In line with previous research, Presence of Meaning and Search for Meaning were negatively related (r     .25, p   .001), and Presence of Meaning was strongly positively related with feelings of optimism, acceptance and life satisfaction. Search for Meaning was negatively related with all three aspects. As expected, correlations among life satisfaction, acceptance, and feelings of optimism were positive. Table 3.

To determine how life satisfaction, acceptance, and feelings of optimism were related, a Confirmatory Factor Analysis was conducted using Mplus 6.0 (Muth n   Muth n, 2010). A first model with the five items of life satisfaction, the optimism item and the acceptance item representing one latent factor indicated an adequate fit,  2(14)   39.61, p   .001, RMSEA   .06, SRMR   .02, CFI   .98 (Hu   Bentler, 1999). However, the path from acceptance to the latent factor was not significant (      .001, p   .82). Therefore, a second model is tested without acceptance resulting in an optimal fit,  2(9)   24.29, p   .01, RMSEA   .06, SRMR   .02, CFI   .99, with all paths significant at p   .001. A composite well - being score was computed including both life satisfaction and feelings of optimism. Acceptance is treated as an additional factor besides well - being. Cluster Analysis on Meaning in Life Cluster analyses were conducted on the dimensions of Presence of Meaning and Search for Meaning. A 4 - cluster solution was retained based on explanatory power (change in  2; Milligan   Cooper, 1985, Calinski - Harabasz index, CH; Steinley, 2006), parsimony, and interpretability. The explained variance in Presence of Meaning and Search for Meaning increased by 44  when moving from 2 to 3 clusters, by 20  when moving from 3 to 4 clusters, by 8  when moving from 4 to 5 clusters, and by 13  when moving from 5 to 6 clusters. However, inspection of the 6 - cluster solution revealed that two clusters were virtually identical to one another, dropping a 6 - cluster solution as a good fitting solution. Furthermore, the 2 - cluster solution explained less than half of variability in both the meaning in life dimensions (21  in Presence of Meaning, 49  in Search for Meaning), dropping a 2 - cluster solution as a good fitting solution. The proportions of the variance explained by the cluster solution ( 2) seem to level off after a 4 - cluster solution (.56 for the 3 - cluster solution, .66 for the 4 - cluster solution, .71 for the 5 - cluster solution). This is confirmed by the CH index which was highest for the 4 - cluster solution when the 6 - cluster solution is not taken into account (CH index respectively 254.88 for the 2 - cluster solution, 315.62 for the 3 - cluster solution, 316.87 for the 4 - cluster solution, 287.15 for the 5 - cluster solution and 326.34 for the 6 cluster solution). Taking these several decision criteria into account, we concluded that a 4 - cluster solution provided the best fit to the data. Figure 1 presents the final cluster solution, with z scores plotted on the y axis. Because the clusters were defined using z scores for the total sample, the cluster's mean z scores indicate how far that cluster deviates from the total sample mean score and from the means of the other four clusters (Scholte et al., 2005). The distances, in standard - deviation units, among the clusters' means (and between each cluster mean and the total sample mean, which is standardized to zero) may be interpreted as an index of effect size. Analogous to Cohen's d, 0.2 SD represents a small effect, 0.5 SD represents a moderate effect, and 0.8 SD represents a large effect. The clusters that we found were characterized by z - scores reflecting moderate to strong deviations from the overall sample mean, suggesting that the four clusters differed considerably in terms of their scores on Presence of Meaning and Search for Meaning. Cluster 1 (24  of the sample) was labeled Low Presence Low Search and consisted of individuals low on both Presence of Meaning and Search for Meaning. Cluster 2 (17  of the sample) was labeled Low Presence High Search and consisted of individuals low on Presence of Meaning and high on Search for Meaning. Cluster 3 (38  of the sample) was labeled High Presence High Search and consisted of individuals high on both Presence of Meaning and Search for Meaning. Finally, cluster 4 (21 ) was labeled High Presence Low Search and consisted of individuals high on Presence of Meaning but low on Search of Meaning. Figure 1. Open in a new tab z scores for Presence of Meaning and Search for Meaning for the four clusters.3 Cluster Differences We conducted a chi - square analysis to examine the extent to which the clusters differed on several sociodemographic variables. No significant differences were found for gender,  2(3)   6.02, p   .11, Cram r's V   .11, educational level,  2(9)   6.81, p   .66, Cram r's V   .07, marital status,  2(l 2)   10.37, p   .58, Cram r's V   .09, and current employment status,  2(15)   24.55, p   .06, Cram r's V   .13. In addition, clusters did not differ with respect to mean age, as indicated by a univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA), F(3, 461)   2.01, p   .11,  2   .01. Furthermore, cluster differences were examined for illness - related factors. No differences were found for illness duration (ANOVA), F(3, 423)   0.54, p   .65, if   .00, or for in - house mobility (ANOVA), F(3, 463)   0.30, p   .83,  2   .00. Regarding out - house mobility, significant differences were found (ANOVA), F(3, 463)   3.47, p   .02,  2   .02, indicating that patients in the Low Presence High Search cluster have more impaired out - house mobility in comparison with the other clusters. A significant chi - square - test,  2(12)   26.66, p   .01, Cram r's V   .14, revealed that patients who seldom or never went out of their house because of their illness were overrepresented in the Low Presence High Search cluster and underrepresented in the High Presence High Search cluster. Two separate ANOVAs were conducted with cluster membership as independent or fixed variable and the composite well - being variable, and acceptance of chronic disease, as dependent variables. The univariate F values,  2, and multiple pairwise combinations conducted using the Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test, are displayed in Table 4. The clusters were associated with a unique profile in terms of the well - being of chronically ill patients and their acceptance of the disease. Effect sizes for all variables were large (more than 13.9  of variance explained; Cohen, 1988).2 Table 4.

Individuals in the High Presence Low Search cluster exhibited the highest levels of well - being and acceptance to chronic disease in comparison to patients in other clusters. Individuals in the High Presence High Search cluster were characterized by a similar profile of the High Presence Low Search cluster except for somewhat lower scores on well - being and acceptance. The Low Presence High Search cluster seemed to be the most poorly adapted group, resulting in very low levels of well - being and acceptance. Individuals in the Low Presence Low Search cluster showed a similar pattern of maladaptation, although they reported somewhat higher levels of well - being and acceptance but significantly lower than the High Presence High Search cluster and the High Presence Low Search cluster. Discussion The present study identified for the first time how distinct dimensions of meaning in life integrate in distinctive profiles in chronically ill patients. Four clusters were found, each characterized by their own unique profile scores on Presence of Meaning and Search for Meaning as well as with specific associations to adaptation. Results of our study affirmed earlier findings that experiencing meaning in life is a potent predictor of high well - being in patients with a chronic disease (Sherman   Simonton, 2012; Yanez et al., 2009). However, our study revealed new insights into the interplay between Presence of Meaning and Searching for Meaning and the effect on patient outcomes. In line with two recent studies focusing on this interplay in a healthy population (Cohen   Cairns, 2012; Dezutter et al., 2013), a distinction could be made between an adaptive and a maladaptive search. In our sample of chronically ill patients, patients in the Low Presence High Search profile show very low levels of well - being and acceptance, which can be indicative of a stressful search for meaning without experiencing meaning in life. This stressful search might hinder the coping process resulting in less optimal psychological well - being. Moreover, especially patients who are highly disabled (not able to go outside) are represented in this maladaptive profile. When searching for meaning is combined with experiencing meaning, the detrimental effect of searching seems reduced. Patients in the High Presence High Search profile seems to exhibit a healthy search reflected in high levels of well - being and acceptance. Patients with low levels of Search for Meaning coupled with low levels of Presence of Meaning also showed lower levels of well - being, however, the pattern is not so detrimental as for the Low Presence High Search profile. This is similar to the findings of Cohen and Cairns (2012) in healthy adults revealing that individuals who reported low levels on Presence of Meaning appeared to be more satisfied if they do not search for meaning. In sum, our findings seem to indicate that patients who experience high levels of meaning in life have higher levels of well - being compared with those patients who experience low levels of meaning. Furthermore, the person - oriented clustering technique seems to distinguish between a stressful search (when no meaning is experienced: Low Presence High Search) resulting in low well - being and a less stressful search (when meaning is experienced: High Presence High Search) resulting in higher well - being. Clinical Implications The present findings provide empirical evidence on the importance of experiencing meaning in life to maintain high levels of well - being when confronted with a chronic illness. If presence of meaning is a psychological resource for patients, health care providers should monitor whether patients experience and or maintain feelings of meaningfulness and coherence. Special attention should be paid to the patients in the clusters characterized by a lack of experiencing meaning. A considerable portion of chronically ill patients in our sample find it difficult to experience meaning in life and seem stuck in a maladaptive search or do not attempt to search at all. Such patients might need clinical help tailored to their needs focusing on finding and obtaining meaning in life amid major health - related adversity. Our findings affirm the need and the importance for developing interventions on meaning that facilitate positive outcomes after the onset of disability in line with the meaning making intervention for cancer patients (MMI; Henry et al., 2010) or the meaning - centered group psychotherapy in palliative care (Breitbart et al., 2010). The routine monitoring of patients' meaning - related concerns, therefore, can signal patients' decreases in meaning and increases in searches, indicating the need for a referral to psychotherapy. The relevance of meaning in life in general patient care and treatment programs has been emphasized by some scholars (e.g., Sulmasy, 2002; Wong, 2012), but these topics are still often neglected within medical practice. The current time pressure in medical care as well as the predominant focus on biological and physiological processes might hamper this discussion in a medical setting. Furthermore, health professionals might also feel inadequate to handle existential topics and questions on personal existence (Yalom, 1980). However, the present findings should encourage clinicians to consider the adaptive as well as maladaptive aspects of meaning in life dimensions and their important role in the coping processes of chronically ill patients. Limitations Future Directions The present results should be interpreted in light of some limitations. First, some factors, such as interest in the study topic or degree of disability, might have influenced the composition of the sample and thus affected the results. Because cluster analysis is a data - driven procedure, the nature of the sample is of paramount importance and limits the generalizations that can be drawn. Hence, replication of the current findings in other samples of chronically ill patients would be encouraged. Second, the sample was heterogeneous regarding disease - type. Research in the field of positive psychology and health has shown that type of disease might influence the results (Aspinwall   Tedeschi, 2010). For example, the relationship between positive phenomena and cancer outcomes is less clear than for heart disease. Although this study provides an excellent first step into understanding how a chronic illness population experiences meaning and searching in life, future studies could focus on distinct diseases, as well as on different stages of disease. Third, the cross - sectional design limits conclusions regarding the directionality of the relationships between meaning in life and adaptation. Well - being may stimulate, as well as be stimulated by, the presence of, or search for, meaning. Hence, longitudinal studies are necessary to clarify the direction of the relations between meaning and adaptation. In addition, our study did not shed light on how meaning in life might impact on well - being. Future studies need to investigate possible underlying cognitive - emotional processes which might explain the link between meaning in life and better well - being. A final limitation is the use of questionnaires. Although questionnaires are appropriate to gather information about subjective and internal concepts such as meaning in life, the sole reliance on self - report measures may have led to an overestimation of some of the correlations among variables due to shared method variance. Additionally, the use of single items for the measurement of some of the indicators can be a limitation. The present findings might be followed up by narrative or mixed - method studies in order to obtain more detailed information on the experiences of meaning and the search for meaning in individuals' lives. Conclusion Despite these limitations, the present study provides an initial glimpse into the complex relationship between Presence of Meaning and Search for Meaning, and how these constructs may play a role in the psychological well - being of individuals confronted with chronic medical stressors. The present findings underscore the importance of Presence of Meaning and they distinguish between a stressful, maladaptive search (the Low Presence High Search cluster) and a benevolent, adaptive search for meaning (the High Presence High Search cluster). However, further research in this field is necessary to replicate the clustering solution in distinct samples and to further clarify the role of meaning in the context of medical stressors, coping, and well - being. Impact and Implications. The present study identifies for the first time how distinct dimensions of meaning in life integrate in distinctive profiles in chronically ill patients. The study confirms that specific meaning in life profiles are related with specific aspects of the well - being of patients. Treatment providers should pay attention to how their patients experience meaning in their life. If patients are struggling with finding meaning of life, this should be a topic of psychotherapy to enhance treatment outcomes and quality of life.
